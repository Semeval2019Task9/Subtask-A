896_10,If so then this issue should concern you as a developer.,0
896_11,The app store currently only shows consumers app ratings and reviews in the country that you live in.,0
896_12,So for example if an app is published in Canada and the United States and only the users in Canada leave a rating/reviews then the users in the United States will not see those ratings and could potentially decide not to download the app.,0
896_13,This also gives the false impression that your app is not good even though you know that people worldwide are enjoying (or not enjoying) the app.,0

896_16,and an easy way to implement is to do this (asides from Bing Translating): ****************************************** Wonderful App Name ***** 200 user reviews worldwide **** 3 reviews in your market *************************************** This way a user can toggle between the world and local reviews.,0

1209_1,It would be great to see this circumvented somehow.,1
1210_1,"One possibility: Instead of having a ""top charts"" style listing, where the most popular apps are displayed to every phone anywhere, create a new form of distribution, where the results are randomized every time a user looks at the marketplace.",1
