388,And when you type GlyphUri in the VS XAML Editor and type equal sign it pops up an opinions menu to open a FontIcon Wizard.,0

398,The document said that `Occurs when the user invokes the system button for close (the 'x' button in the corner of the app's title bar).`,0
399,But when user tapping 'x' button on Sets window ( https://i.imgur.com/WZiITQ6.png ) the event not raised correctly.,0
402,Because - a lot of user post a bug report to the app review on the Microsoft Store.,0
415,The LaunchUriForResultsAsync method works fine.,0
416,But we can't change the size of the window that is opened.,0
417,It is always 500x500.,0

421,When running a UWP app on Win 10 desktop I'm able to add two TimedTextCues to a TimedMetadataTrack with the same StartTime but on mobile it results in a crash.,0

423,If I add the cues to the track before adding the track to mediaSource.ExternalTimedMetadataTracks the crash happens when adding the track.,0

449,The last three days I was working hard to solve a problem submitting our UWP app to the store.,0
450,Now I know why it was not working and I want to make my knowledge public.,0
453,We have an UWP app targeting Windows 10 fall creators update which was published successfully to the sore previously.,0
454, A new version fails the certification process with “10.4.2 App Crash or Freeze”,0
456,Side loadable release builds are also starting and working on our build and test machines,0
458,(This package contains our code compiled with the native tool chain),0
463,This package does always crash after side loading it.,0
464,So this crash is not the problem reported by the certification process!,0
465,Now things are very complicated:,0
466,- The uploaded “.appxupload” package contains the .NET dlls which are compiled via the native tool chain on the Microsoft certification server which generates a package which fails at startup.,0
467,The same build process on my developer machine with the locally installed native tool chain generates perfectly loadable builds.,0
468,Unfortunately there are no more details available from the certification process.,0
469,Also Microsoft support could not help me.,0
470,They build a package which fails without details and I can not download the build package for debugging.,0
473,The test-flight certification process builds the same package internally.,0
474,Fortunately it does not try to start the build as part of the certification process.,0
475,So I was able to install the test flight package on my local machine for debugging.,0
476,And it crashed at startup!,0
478,Using some gflags and VS I was able to find that the entry point for “FormatMessage” was not found.,0
479,- Entry point for “FormatMessage” not found: After some searching I found this https://github.com/AArnott/pinvoke/commit/2843cb918562050fd4e6df1f3fca0c72f4812eb4 and yes I was using this library with the old version.,0
482,So the native tool chain compiles against the wrong entry point which causes the app crash at startup.,0
483,But why was it working on my local machine?,0
484,This is because I am using Visual Studio 15.7.1 which has already fixed the problem.,0
485,Unfortunately the build infrastructure of Microsoft which is used for the UWP certification process (at least for our targeted OS version: Windows 10 falls creators update) uses the buggy version of the SupportedAPIs-x?,0
487,After I used the latest version of PInvoke.Kernel32.dll which contains a workaround for the problem all was fine.,0
490,- The Microsoft Build server for submitted UWP packages is using a buggy “C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\App Certification Kit\SupportedAPIs-x?,0
492,Local release builds created with the native toolchain of VS 15.7.1 are working.,0
493,Here the SupportedAPIs-x?,0
498,I hope this helps!,0
503,Maybe it will help someone.,0
507,Debug build of the app is starting and working on our developer machine,0

519,For WindowsML and MachineLearning.NET applications we need to monitor processor usage specificly by AI processes in task manager.,0
522,After a trial has expired the expiration date is set to:,0
531,Previously this is messy because it requires setting from C# code to measure height of font and multiply by number of lines to set textbox height from code.,0
532,My approach is 100% XAML and doesn't require messy calculations.,0
534,When HeightLine = -1 then the height is set with Height Property.,0
536,The default value for HeightLine can be set to -1 by default to maintain backwards compatibility,0
539,(not everybody cares about drawing pixels on a paper and placing everything that way.... line numbers is enough for a control panel type setttings page...),0
548,It is not clear in what order I should check these properties to allow a user to continue.,0
549,Let's say I have a couple of views and their related viewmodels.,0
550,The viewmodels have some common logic and common properties that I'd like to put in a base view model class to not repeat myself.,0
551,And if I have 5 viewmodels deriving from my base view model and my base view model has the boolean IsLoading property I want to be able to x:Bind to this IsLoading property from each view.,0
552,Several members of returned JSON from Twitter's API are missing from the Services.Twitter implementation.,0

560,WinRT is littered with Async getters that greatly impede porting code and add unnecessary complexity for many cases.,0

612,Audio Source (0x110A) and Sink (0x110B),0
615,Its usage would be similar to SelectedForeground and SelectedBorderBrush:,0
616,SelectedBackground property - Gets or sets a brush that provides the background of a calendar item that's selected.,0
618,I experienced problem with UWP ListView particularly using ISupportIncrementalLoading interface as a datasource.,0
619,A few words about problem context:,0
620,In our UWP app there is a ListView and it uses ISupportIncrementalLoading as a DataSource.,0
621,And while next part of data is loading ListView is disabled.,0
622,So the problem in that if you scroll ListView in way you catch ScrollBar and pull it to the down,0
623,when you scroll to the end of the list ListView will be disabled for some period of time (while data is loading).,0
624,And if you release mouse button from ScrollBar,0
625,while ListView is blocked then some strange behavior of ScrollBar appears after ListView became enabled..,0
626,You cannot hover mouse on ScrollBar because when try to do it ScrollBar goes upper.,0
629,Note 1: I've got success with experiencing this problem in UWP app created from scratch (used ListView and ISupportIncrementalLoading).,0
630,I'd like to attach sample app but I don't understand how (of course if it possible).,0
631,Note 2: if discard of using ISupportIncrementalLoading,0
632,the problem exists but a bit another kind of.,0
633,Thanks in advance!,0
643,Unable to prevent auto close of InputPane which is creating issue due to a possible bug of InputPane in UWP with target version 16299 on Tablet.,0
645,For opening InputPane for 2nd Input element you have to tap outside to lose focus then you will have to tap that input again which will focus input and will open InputPane as its focused now through tapping not by tab button of InputPane.,0
646,This issue has been many times on stack overflow but its still answered.,0
659,For 1803 I like that the backbutton is now built-in to the NavigationView control.,0
660,However the placement of the button looks terrible next to the hamburger button.,0
661,I was actually excited to see it was built into the Nav control because i can't figure out where to place the backbutton either such that it doesn;t look weird and out of place... but the built-in nav backbutton doesn't solve the problem either... it still look weird and extreme beta...,0
662,Currently there's a set of COM APIs that provide access to Virtual Desktop-related features like pinning apps to desktops switching desktops etc.,0
663,Unfortunately most of it is undocumented and does not seem to be stabilized (2018 Spring Update for instance changed IApplicationView's CLSID so apps using it stopped working).,0

743,Normal mouses are working fine but 3D mouse such a SpaceNavigator from 3D Connexion is only able to zoom over RDC.,0
745,Other competitors such as Citrix and HP have already solved this issue with their own Remote Desktop clients.,0
756,Would still keep the Instance property to prevent breaking changes,0
758,App language is English (FlowDirection: LTR),0
759,Swiping a SwipeControl item from the right to the left will reveal the options on the right (as if dragging the item to the left revealing options behind it.,0
761,User changes the language to Arabic (FlowDirection: RTL),0
762,Expectation: User swipes from the left to the right to reveal the options on the left (as if dragging the item to the right to reveal options behind it),0
763,Currently: user swipes from the right to the left to reveal the options on the left (as if the item is moving in the opposite direction of the dragging motion.,0
773,Developers will pass in a UPN (user@domain.com) which will bypass the initial Realm Discovery Dialog - thereby reducing the number of dialogs the user sees during login to the graph.,0
774,We use MediaComposition to generate thumbnails for mp4 video files.,0
775,It's working great on physical machines.,0
776,But on virtual machines we get a InvalidCastException.,0
777,It's happening on multiple different virtualizers (Parallels VirtualBox ...).,0
778,Here is a small testing UWP app:,0
779,I've also posted the full exception there.,0
780,Transferring large amounts of data (10kB) takes way to long when transferred via BLE using native windows functionality as the min connection interval seems to be quite large.,0
781,Using an BLE-Dongle via HCI where it is(!),0
782,possible to set the min conncetion interval the transfer duration of the same data is approximately four times lower than with native BLE.,0
784,Not able to retrieve MAC address of device.,0
788,Without a Header Attribute for the Button Control... it looks like ****... and doesn't line up....,0
791,That would be sort of like going to Starbucks and telling the casher person to leaving room for Cream in your Coffee... where the cream layer is for your Headers....,0
792,The reason why Button needs a Header Attribute is because if I make a grid of a TextBox with Header Field set and a place a button next to it... it looks likes like **** without the header padding to push the button down.,0
797,In the case where no bing maps data is being used (e.g.,0
799,Ideally some way to disable the bing maps access explicitly plus some smart watermark (i.e. 1 ms resolution.),0
807,I believe there is progress coming way for this issue already but I want to post it just to show my desire for it.,0
808,I am attempting to use lsof to find an open port for an application but rather it returns sock: can't identify protocol.,0
809,This occurs because /proc/net/tcp is empty and thus the socket cannot be identified as TCP.,0
811,I selected a set of 3rd party drivers and my PC immediately failed to boot.,0
812,Now I have a painful regime of monkey motion to go through to test them one by one (even with binary search it's going to be painful).,0
814,Thanks in advance for considering this.,0
815,The new WinRT MIDI APIs are broken and have been since their introduction with no sign of plans to be fixed.,0
816,In addition the functionality they provide is still lacking compared to other platforms.,0
817,There is information on this in the other MIDI topics on this page and on GitHub if you do an issue search for winrt midi or uwp midi.,0
819,Delete all Universal Windows Platform,0
820,There is no way to get battery usage of system display Wifi Mobile Data etc.,0
821,But this details are available in BATTERY USE settings,0
823,Currently it only supports touch input.,0
824,I appreciate that swipe controls have come out of developments around touch interfaces.,0
826,Microsoft have set precedent for this in their own apps.,0
827,Outlook for example utilises a SwipeControl type arrangement (that can be interacted with using a mouse) for marking emails as read or unread (among other things).,0
836,And I have a problem with windows explorer that it breaks every time when I try to move from one screen to another.,0
837,I just figured out what was the problem and I can work with it without any problem but I want to post it to see if it can be fixed for another user.,0
838,How to emulate the bug,0
842, - Now with the mouse pointer click on the title of the window and move it to the second screen.,0
843,the problem that I get is that the window will flash and crash the solution is to close it in the taskbar restart the explorer process.,0
845,Then when you move the screen it will not have the same problem.,0
846,I have a Windows 10 notebook with a second screen.,0
850, - Open windows explorer:,0
854,I have an always on background Desktop Bridge app that some users might want to be elevated when it starts at logon.,0
859,isalnum(-1) returns true for some codepages.,0
861,Compile using cl test.cpp /MD and run under RS4.,0
868,WebAuthenticationBroker is becoming obsolete as websites like GitHub are dropping support of the IE browser.,0
874,Working in ABO (Activity Based Office) I use different hardware to my Surface all the time.,0
875,Each time I sit down the display setting for the external screen is to clone but I want it to be extended.,0
876,My Customer (I'm an Office 365 Consultant) are struggling with the adoption of this new way of working because of simple things like this that annoy and takes 2-10 minutes per person per working spot.,0
878,The following example doesn't show an error in the Designer but throws errors in the generated code.,0
883,The above case is trying to subtract from the width of another element but clamp it within a specific range.,0
892,Currently it seems to be sorted by Unicode code points which doesn't make any sense for Chinese characters at least.,0
893,I have a disk imaging application (which I have already converted) that writes bytes directly to disk (USB and SD cards).,0
894,It requires admin rights to get a lock on the disk.,0
897,There are thousands of apps out there that probably aren't converted for similar reasons.,0
902,Test apps (although hidden in the store) undergo the same certification process.,0
905,The submission process for test apps takes too long.,0
910,I have been trying to get my son into programming and so far his dev experience has been less than exciting.,0
911,He wants to debug his game real time but the emulator is a pain to deal with forces and gps etc.,0
912,Allegedly this works however I have found thread after thread of people looking for a real solution but no one appears to make any headway because VS gives useless feedback.,0
913,I have spent an entire day trying to get something anything working.,0
914,if I choose device I get a generic error (vie tried every suggestion I can find online) if I choose remote machine I am prompted for a pin so I go into the for devs page on my device and I hit pair and I get a 6 digit pin.,0
915,that pin doesn't work though so the pin screen wont go away.,0
916,I was able to finally build an app package that I can manually move o the device in the portal but I shouldn't have to do that and it breaks the debug chain.,0
922,The link to the PrinterExtensionLibrary for UWP points to 8.1.,0
927,Is that be design?,0
928,Hello I am new to the forum so I apologize if this is not in the incorrect area to post this.,0
930,I am active Windows Insider users currently enrolled to receive the fastest Windows Inside Builds.,0
931,I currently use Cortana each day on Windows 10 Android and iPhone.,0
935,I have noticed that sometimes the microphone function on the iPhone and Android app tends to stall or freeze.,0
936,It doesn't matter if I set the microphone to open upon application launch or activate the microphone; the delay in time the user has to wait to speak to Cortana is quite noticeable.,0
938, I understand the limitations of Apple so it's unlikely the user will be able to respond to a text message directly on a Windows 10 PC.,0
947,For example when I want to go to my user path just Ctrl + R enter ~ then press Enter.,0
948,Or want to go to System drive path currently I press Windows key enter C: then press enter.,0
951,My country Maldives isnt listed in Aure sign up.,0
953,The ability to use products like Office with VR.,0
954,I can program my buttons in my Vive to mimic my fingers.,0
957,Since I work in a data center I actually need a screen transfer hereby it would be easy to install programs,0
958,I have a driver causing a memory leak.,0
960,Poolmon is not offered as a standalone tool and only as part of the Windows Driver Kit so I must download the entire Windows Driver Kit to access this one small tool.,0
961,In order to download the Windows Driver Kit I must first install Visual Studio 2017.,0
962,I am not going to download multiple GBs of **** that I will never use to fix a memory leak.,0
963,That just turns my memory leak issue into a hard-drive bloat issue.,0
965,Thanks for nothing Microsoft.,0
967,Microsoft's official support reccomends that I use a tool called poolmon to find which driver is causing the leak.,0
974,Scenario: An application saving different file formats with the same file extension (example: choices for TXT files when saving with Excel MS Office).,0
975,Case (tested): When using FileSavePicker with UWP even if the application adds different choices with the same file extension then it is not possible to know which of those choices the user actually selected.,0
976,FileSavePicker just returns a StorageFile class for the file name and extension.,0
977,Issue: I developed a Desktop application saving files with different formats with the same file extension (using SaveFileDialog and FilterIndex) and currently UWP would not allow me to convert the application from Desktop without adding additional menu options or dialogs so the user can chose what he/she wants.,0
978,This means adding more steps to select something that is already shown on the FileSavePicker dialog which I think it would eventually affect in a way the user experience.,0
980,* Scenario: An application saving different file formats with the same file extension (example: choices for TXT files when saving with Excel MS Office).,0
981,* Case (tested): When using FileSavePicker with UWP even if the application adds different choices with the same file extension then it is not possible to know which of those choices the user actually selected.,0

984,You know it for sure: one developer produces great software like Google Chrome Paint.net or many others.,0
985,The other developers try to force customers to use their software for example M$ with Edge and Paint 3D.,0
986,M$ even tries to pay customers to use Bing & Edge.,0
990,If necessary you could send your incompetent product managers to the competitors - at least at school so the can learn how great Software has to feel and look like.,0
992,M$ just displays 4 lines.,0
993,It feels like M$ is begging the customers to send no feedback because M$ hates it but must do something.,0
1000,This is the crezy idea:,0
1001,M$ could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves because it's just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users.,0
1007,How about letting the user decide whether My People should use these animated notifications or normal Toasts.,1
1009,I'm missing the ability to change the font name/size and color.,0
1012,I'm not a developer.,0
1013,I'm a school teacher.,0
1014,I am considering future options for puchasing devices.,0
1016,There doesnt seem to be any website for this.,0
1019,I understand that cloudbooks are meant to largely be web based tools.,0
1020,But there are still times when you want to install some things.,0
1021,I also understand that this will be something that software manufacturers will be requesting to MS directly.,0
1033,With F# still not providing a way to code a full application for the desktop using UWP after several years of people waiting I want to call for bringing Common Lisp to the platform.,0
1035,Machines now have the power to really make Lisp shine and show all it can do to empower UWP developers to create amazing solutions.,0
1040,The users that are already subscribed to the Add-on will keep the same price as before but the new Users will get the new price.,0
1041,What's the reason that currently Microsoft is blocking a price increase?,0
1042,It's not really convenient for developers to create every time a new Add-on when they want to increase the price.,0
1043,We tried to embrace Microsoft's vision for UWP but failed misreably wasting lots of time and money.,0
1044,We built a UWP application that reads public data off ISO 7816 smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode.,0
1045,In debug mode it all works fine.,0
1046,In release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification.,0
1047,The smartcard functionality however which is based on a .net standard 2.0 library fails to work (https://github.com/danm-de/pcsc-sharp),0
1048,We are now trying to use the native UWP SmartCard API but its largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit APDU which are the basic communication block,0
1050,For now we have no option but to re-build the app to a non-Microsoft environment.,0
1057,The wireless card worked well till windows 7.,0
1058,Now this is a mess.,0
1059,Intel says they cannot Give update.,0
1062,I have to do it whenever there is some heavy thing between Computer and Hub.,0
1063,Microsoft can set a Do while loop in its generic drivers Also,0
1079,it wont let me cconnect it just sais turn on,0
1080,The following page https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/ does not work in IE.,0
1081,I cannot expand FAQ entries and so on.,0
1082,The page above also recommends me to set up the MS Edge.,0
1083,The MS Edge is incompatible with my LTSB system.,0
1087,For some languages - Chinese for example - ink recognition results tend to have lots of errors.,0
1092,Here is a related StackOverflow question:,0
1094,In UWP I extract the pages of a PDF using the method PdfDocument.GetPage(UInt32 pageIndex) and save the page as image to the local disk using PdfPage.RenderToStreamAsync(IRandomAccessStream outputStream).,0
1095,In the saved image the headers in the PDF pages are not rendered.,0
1096,The sample and the PDF document can be downloaded from the link below.,0
1099,This is so ridiculous that windows update doesn't have any rule and there is no way (believe me I googled a lot) to allow it securely (without allowing whole svhost.exe) even spotify has a default rule!,0
1101,I'm using lates windows 10 edition (build 1709),0
1103,Please don't reply me with this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc708605(v=ws.10),0
1104,There is no way for adding dns names in windows firewall and also it is not secure.,0
1105,Also please don't reply me with answers under this https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/27ded2ad-cc85-4c0a-9b41-c6b469a20aab/windows-firewall-and-windows-update-win-81,0
1106,I already tried renaming svhost.exe with no luck.,0
1110,I changed the windows firewall default to block anything without a rule.,0
1116,Both Process Isolation and Hyper-V Isolation for Containers are available in Windows Server 2016 but Windows 10 only supports Hyper-V isolation.,0
1117,Hyper-V isolation has benefits but also has many drawbacks such as resource allocation performance as well as stability.,0
1118,A simple check of the Docker for Windows issues board ( https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues ) shows a large imbalance of Windows 10 and Hyper-V isolation related issued where the Windows Server 2016 issues are much less common.,0
1125,Hello I want to protect some user-mode code and read only data against other user-mode modification from a kernel-mode driver while allowing process handle creation.,0
1126,MmSecureVirtualMemoryAgainstWrites seems to do the job but it's undocumented and not even exported.,0
1127,In my enterprise application basically a sales and purchase application.,0
1128,Currently UWP allow RenderTargetBitmap API to render framework element in xaml to image which currently in viewed in screen.,0
1129,But in my case i want to print receipt and don't want to show the receipt in the screen and just pass the bitmap image of receipt to POS Printer.,0
1130,But RenderTargetBitmap API doesn't work in Background.,0
1136,In UWP XAML binding something that is NOT an ICommand to an event gives an exception in the XAML compiler WCM9999: Object Reference not set to an instance of an object.,0
1139,I would expect it to catch this an give a readable error message about an invalid binding idealy the propertyname and the control type at least.,0
1140,Something that lets you investigate.,0
1141,Using Microsoft gift cards as developer account registration fee.,0
1142,well it's really powerful for indie devs,0
1143,Let's say there is a app which display news stories.,0
1144,The app does not want to have too many stories on the screen and load stories on demand.,0
1145,The first time the app is opened it downloads news article and display's say the top 10 to user in a ListView and rest are stored locally.,0
1146,These are displayed if the user scrolls down (Incremental Loading Collection Helpers are great addition).,0
1147,Now let's say next day the app is opened again.,0
1148,App immediately displays yesterday's news stories and works in background to load new stories (or user pulls to refresh).,0
1149,As soon as new stories are downloaded they are added at the from of the ListView not all but say top 10 and rest goes to the disk/cache.,0
1150,Now if user scrolls down more stories are fetched from the cache/disk.,0
1162,on Windows 10 UWP apps if you rapidly click or unintentionally double-click on any control supporting click/tapped event its associated Click event handler will execute for each.,0
1163,This can cause a lot of unintended side effects.,0
1164,For example if the Click event handler brings up a modal ContentDialog with the ShowAsync command an additional click will cause the event handler to fire again before modal isolation occurs and create another ContentDialog which causes an exception if not handled will result in a crash of the application.,0
1167,Tablet Version: Microsoft Windows [version 10.0.16299.248],0
1171,Target version: Windows 10 (10.0; Build 10586),0
1179,It used to do this in Windows 8 and early Windows 10 versions but this apparently changed a while ago.,0
1184,This will be a good addition.,0
1186,It is understandable that when UWP app is run normally it can only access a limited set of COM objects; however if the UWP is packaged to desktop bridge it makes sense to allow it to access additional COM objects exposed by that desktop bridge using the technical described in the blog above.,0
1187,Without this support if a desktop bridge contains a UWP app and a win32 app exposes out-of-proc COM objects the only way UWP app can communicate with the win32 app is through AppService.,0
1188,This brings a lot of overhead and unnecessary work to add AppService into win32 app and sometimes it is impossible if win32 source code is not available.,0
1190,Packaged COM (https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/04/13/com-server-ole-document-support-desktop-bridge/#KgekWJeWFmOwUZRb.97) allows exposing out-of-proc COM objects using desktop bridge however these COM objects are not accessible from UWP apps even if the UWP apps are packaged into same desktop bridge exposes the COM objects.,0
1194,We are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated Xbox Apps.,0
1195,It used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on Xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high.,0
1196,Now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on Xbox and by default EVERY windows 10 app that is published is published on all devices.,0
1197,I know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device - but it means that when we publish an app now our app is barely out a day and it is pushed way down the new apps list - making it almost impossible to generate organic downloads from curious users.,0
1198,That is fine if we are being kept out by other Xbox apps - but we released an app last week and currently there are about 2 dozens apps ahead of us - half that won't even work on an Xbox with a controller.,0
1199,It is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem.,0
1200,One simple example is there is a PDF database app on the new apps list on XBOX!,0
1201,You cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on Xbox One.,0
1202,Yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section.,0
1204,It is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it.,0
1209,I know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device,0
1210,Currently desktop bridge supports in app purchases.,0
1212,As of now there is no good ad network for existing desktop applications.,0
1213,This feature is almost available in any web based video player or any Desktop based video player the feature is simple.,0
1214,When a mediaplayerelement is playing or paused a video.,0
1215,and the user hover overs the seekbar with mouse or pen or any other input device for that perspective wherver is the user mouse show a small thumbnail of the video file at that specific position just above the seekbar ( slider ) and as the user moves the mouse along the seekbar the thumbnail should update accordingly.,1
1217,I'm aware of the sandboxing.,0
1222,In UWP applications with the codeGeneration manifest capability allow the use of the existing exception table APIs currently marked desktop-only.,1
1223,On UWP for x86-64 ARM and ARM64 it's not possible to comply with the Windows ABI when generating code at runtime because you cannot generate the mandatory exception table data for the dynamically-generated code.,0
1235,Otherwise this function is useful to runtime code generation.,0
1240,So I uninstalled KB4057144 became build 15063.850.,0
1241,Re-try desktop app converter was successes.,0
1242,I think that it is the problem of baseimage and KB4057144.,0
1243,Of course Version 1709 build 16299.214 can use the DAC.,0
1244,Currently Microsoft Store under Windows 10 shows three types of information:,0
1248,But there's no numerical value representing the amount of data that will have to be downloaded.,0
1249,Please fix this annoying issue.,0
1251,Many applications need only Desktop support.,0
1252,UWP is too safe so as to be impractical for so many desktop apps and WPF is like a third-class citizen with Microsoft in the background cheering Upgrade to UWP!,0
1253,The sandbox nonsense has to go.,0
1257,Let them install it if they so choose.,0
1258,99% of the applications they install aren't (and won't be!) sandboxed UWP applications anyway.,0
1270,But it is not available by default.,0
1272,im using file explorer but if ı can seee my otler drives like D drive ore E drive ıts gona be more handfull,0
1273,CalcBinding is an advanced Binding markup extension that allows you to write calculated binding expressions in XAML without custom converters.,0
1274,CalcBinding can automatically perform bool to visibility conversion inverse your expression and more.,0
1275,CalcBinding makes binding expressions shorter and more user-friendly.,0
1276,This is only available for WPF - https://github.com/Alex141/CalcBinding,0
1277,Here are some examples,0
1285,Right now it's possible to define apps for websites using app URI handlers.,0
1287,These excludePaths feature supports only path matching right now not wildcards for the whole Uri.,0
1290,UWP combobox is not showing the selected value under certain resolutions.,0
1292,In visual studio if I select the container (a grid) and change something like the flow from horizontal to vertical the redraw fixes the issue which leads me to believe that it's the render.,0
1293,We use the Create Date on log files to check if they can be deleted.,0
1294,The problem is that when we delete that file and recreate it (same filename) the create date stays the same!,0
1296,How to reproduce.,0
1298,It creates a test.log file.,0
1301,Run the code again.,0
1304,The test.log file is created again.,0
1305,Check the create on the test.log it still has the create date from the first time you ran the code!,0
1308,Run this as many times as you like the create date will not change from the first time you ran the code.,0
1319,It deletes the file.,0
1325,Having SOCK_SEQPACKET would remove the burden of distinguishing between independent messages from the user.,1
1326,It also allows greater compatibility for existing POSIX-compatible applications as was the original goal for implementing AF_UNIX.,0
1327,This would be comparable to the message mode of Windows named pipes making AF_UNIX sockets a more complete replacement.,0
1329,Some users certainly will find this useful.,0
1331,Sadly if you're someone who finds this annoying there's no option to disable this behavior.,0
1332,According to the singular post I was able to find on this new feature (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_desktop/programs-autostart-after-boot-in-windows-10/09dd8d3e-7b36-45d1-9181-6587dd5d53ab?page=2&auth=1) there is no way to disable this.,0
1334,The new fall creators update seems to have introduced a 'feature' where if a user reboots the system any applications that were open (well some at least it seems as though to make this issue even more confusing not all applications follow this convention) will automatically launch on reboot.,0
1336,Others may find this annoying.,0
1341,It currently only supports octet-stream.,0
1342,In trying to use SHA2 Timestamp(current Microsoft guidelines) servers the powershell cmdlet set-authenticodesignature fails to apply the timestamp.,0
1343,This cmdlet uses the cryptuiwiz api.,0
1344,Here's the sample script to reproduce the error,0
1348,Actually we can't because the same notification would be send too if the user is closing the application.,0
1352,This issue was reported for Visual Studio Feedback Site but They have determined that this issue belongs to universal windows platform.,0
1353,Currently we have no notifying system to the developers when the customer add new feedback to the feedback hub.,0
1355,It's tooo painful.,0
1356,Is it possible to add the notification system?,1
1358,Uservoice already have it.,0
1361,It's a control carryover from as far back as W95 & W98 ...... Linux & Mac system systems have never had this issue,0
1362,Create a new blank UWP application and add this XAML code:,0
1364,When I run this I expect to get no suggestions in the software keyboard when writing anything in the text box.,0
1365,This works as expected on phones but not on computers/tablets.,0
1366,I'm using Fall Creators update not sure how it behaves in other versions.,0
1368,In my case I'm writing an app where you learn how to spell and don't want to give the user any hints :-),0
1376,We are developing components on Linux which has dedicated system call and memory requests.,0
1378,This would signify communication and access on the file system.,0
1381,I have some more feature recommendations regarding extensions in adaptivegridview if you will.,0
1384,and which operator to use [AND/OR] in case of multiple property filter provided.),0
1386,and this grouping will obviously include the semantic zoom feature as well.,0
1387,Incremental Loading: I know this is already in the community toolkit.,0
1389,Sorting : sorting with 1 or more properties.,0
1390,List/GridSwitcher : there can be a toggle button on the top of the control which can toggle the control to view as a listview ( each item expanded fully ) or to a gridview ( normal grid like behaviour ),1
1391,These are some of the most common scenarios which are required by developers and there are many ways to do it but this can get very complicated to align them with best practices.,0
1394,This can be a very powerful control/page yet looking very good to the eye as well.,0
1397,this search bar auto filters the items on basis of the filterDescriptor provided ( filter descriptor can be defined by the developer tht which stringtimeint property to match with which condition i.e : Contains startswith endswith e.t.c.,0
1401,I have used Unity+UWP to develop LOB application that visualizes 3D data from opened files.,0
1402,We also use multiple-top-level windows that are already available.,0
1403,Now client wants to allow opening and visualizing multiple files which would have been easy with Win32 (just launch another instance).,0
1405,I have a disk imaging (which I have already converted) application that writes bytes directly to disk (USB and SD cards).,0
1407,The app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required.,0
1411,So in a round about way you're actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead.,0
1418,Current clipboard API can notify about a clipboard content change which is fine.,0
1421,This limitation results in a bad user experience because there are scenarios where the user is working with one application and another application performs some operations based on the copied content.,0
1429,But getting or setting the content doesn't work if the app is in background or unfocused.,0
1432,Or the other way around; where one application creates data and sets the content automatically and the user can directly use it inside another application.,0
1437,Currently the input will be validated if the focus of the Textbox lost.,0
1445,I can verify that this works.,0
1446,But unfortunately it is not possible to create a MediaStreamSample from D3D Surface.,0
1449,This will allow us to do full hardware accelerated video decoding.,0
1450,x:Bind is great and I love it.,0
1456,2) This limit appears to be arbitrary and not on par with other platforms (iOS / Android / Mac OSX).,0
1457,This limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience (and developer experience) when compared to these other platforms.,0
1459,This idea is so bad on so many levels.,0
1460,So what is the suggestion:,0
1463,As a Xamarin.Forms developer I had to drill down 4 frameworks to find this limitation.,0
1464,As bad as the Android docs are they at least make an effort to publish limits.,0
1465,3) DO NOT SUGGEST a steam roller as a work around to a shortcoming in a fly swatter.,0
1466,Especially if that steam roller is riddled with security issues and complexity way beyond the experience and latitude of most fly swatter users.,0
1467,In [this](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/6187a2cc-2683-4b15-b1e6-d90f3703ad0b/uwp-c-emailmanager-message-body-getting-truncated?forum=wpdevelop&prof=required) following forum post the character limit for an email body generated via code from an app is noted.,0
1476,ContentDialog is currently far too difficult to use for two reasons: locking and placement.,0
1479,Since only one ContentDialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed (such as SemaphoreSlim(11) or a sequential queue of TaskCompletionSource).,1
1480,In other words the class is not complete because normal use of it requires wrapping it in additional code.,0
1482,This means that ContentDialog.ShowAsync will wait until any currently-displayed ContentDialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog.,0
1485,If ShowAsync() or ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.Popup) is used then the location of the dialog is not well controlled.,0
1487,On the other hand if ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.InPlace) is used then (a) it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in XAML and (b) it doesn't always work because an exception occurs if ShowAsync(InPlace) is called on the dialog before the XAML is fully loaded.,0
1488,For example an error dialog that is required early during program startup cannot be shown based on a copy embedded in XAML.,0
1490,(In addition per (1) above a lock of some kind is needed).,0
1502,Currently when the last element(s) of the tile doesn't fit (because of users with unusual scaling settings for example) it get's discarded out of view which is understandable.,0
1504,It also helps with dealing with the scenario where because of the users scaling settings there is too much space on the tile where the developer could have shown extra info.,0
1505,PasswordVault.FindAllByResource throws a COMException when there are no credentials for the resource (or maybe only when there are no credentials).,0
1506,It should return an empty list without throwing an exception.,0
1507,right now the window.closed event for desktop fires both for minimization and for closing events.,0
1508,I understand this is done because of the multiplatform support but it just makes desktop apps with multiple Windows harder 5o manage so please.,0
1510,A good web example can be found here https://material.angular.io/components/chips/overview,0
1512,We are able to download previous versions of the release versions of the Windows SDK.,0
1514,On the slow ring we are currently on Windows build 17025 but the only SDK download link provided on the Windows Insider download page is for 17061 at time of writing.,0
1515,I am not willing to go to fast ring because this renders my laptop useless.,0
1518,When you invoke the primary or secondary buttons in a ContentDialog you are not losing focus in the control that was last being edited.,0
1519,If you are using x:Bind to bind that control's value to a property in the ContentDialog code-behind page then when you press the primary button the property doesn't get updated.,0
1520,I've tried forcing the control (in this case a TextBox) to lose focus programmatically in the Primary buttonevent handler but this does not help.,0
1521,Ive also tried Bindings.Update - bit this does not help either.,0
1527,The expected behaviour is that when you click on the Primary,0
1528,I can't register dev account because of living in Republic of Moldova.,0
1530,There are thousands of programmists here too.,0
1531,Currently there does not appear to be a way to set a window's startup position (left top width/right height/bottom) beyond full-screen and/or maximized.,0
1532,Also the last used position for a given window isn't saved intrinsically.,0
1533,Windows launch at random places on the desktop.,0
1534,I understand this need does not really exist for mobile.,0
1535,But for many desktop applications specifically container applications managing windows is a core feature objective.,0
1536,it is similar like this issue : http://www.dcfever.com/cameras/specification.php?id=1620,0
1537,We've inherit a control from Slider and put it in horizontal.,0
1538,If Windows set to 125% DPI and when slider value is the same as its maximum value.,0
1539,Our App would crash.,0
1540,If we use Application.ExecutablePath when the user open the Shortcut he gets an access permission error so I'm trying to create it using shell:AppsFolder\ but I can't get the AppUserModelId,0
1541,I'm on a DesktopBridge App and when I try to use Windows.ApplicationModel.AppInfo its null,0
1544,Setting ProtextedText to On doesn't work the selected text is still modifiable.,0
1547,Editor is the value of x:Name given to RichEditBox element.,0
1550,RotatorTile's behavior is like an automated FlipView.,0
1553,Microsoft has added in the Camera App the Panorama Mode which works in some devices and tablets.,0
1554,Don't know if it is a specific number of devices that currently this feature works.,0
1556,Is this possible to use this feature in our Windows App Store Universal Apps and if we can  do we have any sample code to accomplish this ?,0
1557,Don't want a solution with the scrollviewer and the compass because I have already done that.,0
6720,The app list should be in grid style and background should be customized.,1
6721,The keyborad should also be customized like the gadget comfort on-screen keyboard in windows 7 (desktop).,1
6724,Please allow us to maintain all app packages store assets descriptions screenshots and metadata in a Git repository and simply push to a Git remote to upload.,1
6728,Instead we could get everything ready locally and do a push and upload it all quickly.,1
6732,What I would like to see is a button on the language description pages that are supported for an app.,1
6737,and put it onto the description field for Japanese for example) For my app I have it in about 36 language/Country descriptions which is a big task to handle.,0
6738,The user could then review the translations as best as they could.,0
6739,And if Microsoft couldn't translate it it could just copy over the original text.,0
6742,That would take your default language description and fields and then use Microsoft's Translator to translate all the fields to the language.,0
6745,Please add support C++/CX extension and type system for Desktop platform.,1
6750,And it's good if it will be work on Windows 7 too.,1
6757,Please comment and document this behavior,1
6760,Therefore I want to request adding of some improvements in WinRT API to bring Frame's behavior closer to it's analog from WP Silverlight.,1
6780,So would be great if Microsoft things in this way also.,0
6782,It should be typed as it is typed in Gujarati 'દ્વિ'.,0
6788,It would be great to have a Background Trigger when that data was changed on another device.,1
6799,It is great that we can Schedule Tile updates so that I can always show the latest timings on the tile itself but I would love it if I could do the same thing with Badges.,1
6806,Attempting to use TextAlignment within Page.Resources and referencing it via StaticResource in a Universal Windows App will compile but throw an exception.,0
6809,When Cortana has an expression that it doesn't understand based on the available expressions registered but Cortana does recognize an app name it would be great if the user's expression was fed to the app account on the store for the developer to review and consider supporting in the future.,1
6818,Window should stay the size I left it.,1
6831,Please add CAN API to be included in the Windows.Devices.,1
6837,Companies like CSHTML5 (http://cshtml5.com) and DuoCode (http://duoco.de) are already doing this but it would be great to see this effort officially adopted into the Microsoft Universal Windows Platform.,0
6841,A mechanism that operates like PhoneGap/Cordova would have to be implemented so that access to external hardware APIs can be achieved.,1
6859,A Bonus would be to be able to set a link for all users (incl. .Net API preferred at least Win32 API,1
6867,Hope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots.,0
6869,My thought: Using simulator while on a page a one-click button that automatically take one screenshot for each language the app supports.,0
6871,In the upload website a way to remove all screenshots and a way to upload all assets for all languages at once.,1
6872,Developers should be able to make custom lockscreen app.,1
6878,It is very important that we support beta for both Windows Phone and Windows.,1
6881,Allow users of paint to select parts of images on an image they're drawing or editing diagonally other than only horizontally/vertically.,1
6883,You could even make it possible to select the angle at which you select a certain part of the image manually and this would certainly make editing in paint a lot easier.,1
6885,Please provide the ability to the developer to change the color of the keyboard inside their app.,1
6888,Now this may not be so bad in English which has relatively short words but languages like German or Danish make heavy use of compound words.,0
6889,Words can get very long and thus hyphenation is needed - especially on small screens.,1
6896,This would also bring feature parity with HTML/JS apps which already… more,0
6897,API to detect incoming call and number so it can be blocked if not necessary and also can ring even in silent if it is important.,1
6902,It would be great to have the option for creating Publisher’s shared roaming folder as well.,1
6904,Open sideloading for everyone.,1
6908,It would be better if this file was in JSON format and followed the Manifest for web application standard from W3C: http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/,1
6910,Allow changing country and publisher name after registration on the Store,1
6915,Please either extend the existing class to consider the use cases for the phone or ditch it and come up with something more like Apple's approach which works better than what's currently there.,1
6919,Unfortunately this means the app is a none-starter because the files can be several gigabytes in size so it kills the user experience everytime they try to open a file.,0
6920,The Emulator should support SensorSDK,1
6925,I propose you add a proper unit test suite for the WinJS platform that can be automated and ideally run from common JavaScript tools like Grunt.,1
6934,Please document how transitions work and expose the necessary API for us to create our own drop in replacements for the limited set of transitions supplied by the existing APIs.,1
6935,For example on WP if I want to use a custom transition I can fake the transition by using animations at the exit and entry to a page but in order for this to work I need to remove the existing stack of transitions from the frame because navigation will reuse the last transition from the frame's collection.,0
6938,At the very least we need a No Op transition that can be used to prevent the frame's stack from using the last transition to animate the page change.,1
6959,This feature is to ask for Xaml serialization featureset parity with WPF/System.Xaml.,1
6962,It could be better to have search box in windows phone application instead of having it in windows application alone.,1
6964,Auto focusing the input element in page ready is not working in windows mobile application.,0
6966,As a developer I should have access to the entire WinRT API if I am building an app for my own personal device.,1
6970,Perhaps more developers would build for Windows if they can build their own tools for personal use without so many restrictions.,1
6980,This is an excellent feature but I would love to see the same tools and support available for the shared project in a universal WinJS app.,1
6981,It would be great to use Bower to install scripts once into the shared project rather than installing two copies of the same script into the Windows project and the Windows Phone project.,1
6982,It makes sense to disallow universal C#/Xaml apps installing packages to the shared project because they might only target Windows 8 or only target Windows Phone.,1
6984,Therefore there should be no problem with installing scripts directly to the shared project using Bower instead of installing two copies of the same script to two different projects.,0
6992,It would make sense i think that en (no region) language will be used as a fallback for all en countries if there is no en-region specified.,1
7003,Please implement a permanent fix to the relevant back-end systems.,1
7004,Also we need a supplementary fix to the issues faced by existing affected users without resorting them to contacting Microsoft customer support to restore their purchase by way of adding credit to re-purchase the app.,1
7017,If you add more than a few like 25+ the performance is so bad that you have to wait for a few seconds after you stop to be sure that the pins/controls are in the right position.,0
7032,Either use the Identity version throughout the Store and let us change that with the Visual Studio Wizard or ensure that the Dev Center reads the Package version (rather than Identity version).,1
7036,Visual Studio's Create Package wizard allows one to assign a version number however this assigns the Package version number.,0
7050,I would like some way so that I can have my various devices (each with different form factor) get the latest build deployed to them all or a select number of them instead of debugging simply failing.,1
7086,PubCenter users should be able to decide how much they want to receive when they get a payment.,1
7088,It would be great if I could decide to receive less money in a single payment and keep the rest for the next year.,1
7089,Expose an API that allows apps aside Phone and Messaging to trigger Person reminders.,1
7104,Polish your new Contact Manager api to get the maximum performance .Hence the user not to sit idle till it loads.,1
7107,It may be based on number only contacts contacts with email address or filtering only phone contacts other than any social contacts etc.,0
7120,Please consider my suggestion on this case,0
7130,Please provide a simpler example with a clearer coding.,1
7133,I think it is good to explain what is default image.,1
7137,Please provide support for adding developer user id to Windows Developer account.,1
7139,Hope that Microsoft (if possible) allow us individuals to create individual developer account for FREE and allowed only to publish one app on Windows Phone or Windows store.,1
7157,Please add a link to https://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/Account/Summary that links to the password change page at https://dev.windowsphone.com.,1
7158,Also add the same LIVE profile password change link to the Windows Store profile.,1
7160,Might be nice to make it easier to find the right password change page.,1
7161,Allow background services to display controls on top of other applications.,1
7162,It would be great to for example play a video in a small square box while browsing the web or respond to messages without having to open a message app.,1
7163,Please support m3u8 live streamings,1
7164,Please Please Please expand the 'Email Signature' function so that you are able to include a detailed signature including embeded images.,1
7166,By using the FileOpenPicker class we can filter shown files by extensión but I think we should also be able to filter files by their name let's say: I only want to show pictures whose name start with ABCD or whose name ends with  BCD.,1
7169,So Please Provide this option.,0
7173,The dev team should be able to access info through the dashboard.,1
7192,Make .Net available on all platforms(including Mac Linux all Smartphones).,1
7207,Microsoft could have created more tools for integrating NHibernate easily into .net apps but they developed EntityFramework instead… more,1
7208,Just like in WinRT could we have Spell Checking options and Text Prediction in Window Phone Silverlight apps.,1
7209,I was working on clipboard manager application for windows 8 and discovered that there is no way to catch Clipboard.ContentChanged event when application is running in background seems the life cycle of WinRT app doesn't allow this.,0
7210,Wish I would have a possibility to create a background task that is triggered by clipboard content changed system event.,1
7212,Add WebP support so I can easily process and export images using the format.,1
7214,We want access to every camera available at same tima.,1
7224,I think there should be a property (maybe something like ShowDeleteButton) that allows you to specify whether the Delete button is displayed.,1
7226,A/B testing is crucial for quantitative marketing.,0
7235,I'd like to see the ability to re-order my related apps so I can choose which related apps get promoted first to users.,1
7238,Let the local apps install without need to access to windows phone store just like .exe files in windows...,1
7242,After profiling the app I found that after calling MediaCapture.capturePhotoToStorageFileAsync method memory is not released and allocates 10-20 MB with each call.,0
7243,I've also voted for this suggestion as that could fix most of camera related issues on Windows phone:,0
7251,The only way to detect it is by looking for UnauthorizedException but that exception is ambiguous.,0
7256,A location permission dialog may be showing when a network error occurs in an unrelated part of the code for example.,0
7269,Perhaps ensuring a 1 year gap between signups would be enough of a deterrent to those that may want to maliciously close their account regularly.,1
7274,Please include my country Yemen in pay out and advertisement too.,1
7279,DatePicker should be allowed to have a null value initially and not a programmatically set that could accidentally be mistake for a user's input.,1
7281,Setting DayVisible to false prevents the spinner from showing which is nice but then the date is displayed when the value is shown in the field which sort of negates the feature.,0
7288,It would be nice if an app could provide its own tasks / todos to the OS.,1
7297,I do alot of copying and pasting and would really like to see a customized copy and paste built into windows.,1
7300,That way when I paste I still have the other files in memory to paste elsewhere.,0
7304,If I can copy like say 4 - 10 different files/folders it would be nice to have a selection when I right click and place my mouse over paste I would like to see a Paste - All Paste select which would have check boxes on each folder/file I have selected to copy.,1
7312,Please provide APIs and support of iBeacons technology and also BLE scanning without pairing just like using Advertising Package so that we can exchange data to or from target device.,1
7326,Replace Most Used Tags/attributes With Number.,1
7333,all the developers needs to do is some thing like this:,0
7346,If you think about productivity this is not a way to do it.,0
7357,Allow changing the country and name after registration on Windows Phone Store PubCenter and Windows Store.,1
7365,Pubcenter Ads should not play sound unless clicked on or have a way to mute ad sounds.,1
7371,Allow developers to add suggestions to the user's wordflow keyboard.,1
7383,You might throw up a MessageDialog in the catch clause.,0
7384,It would be nice to have a ShowForAsyncAction method or something so that you have one call and don't have to worry about cleanup.,1
7390,It would be nice to have one thing with three states rather than two things who have two states each.,1
7402,Developers need to write additional code -using the deprecated DirectInput API- to access those devices even though Microsoft states that use of DirectInput should be avoided and XInput used instead for any gamepad functionality.,0
7403,There should be an update to XInput API that will add functions so to migrate and simplify that functionality from DirectInput.,1
7410,You should also be able to undelete an app package for 24 hours after you delete.,1
7411,You should also be able make a backup of this information so if it does get delete you can always restore it.,1
7478,For the testcase source code see below.,0
7495,You should officially support Windows Template Library (WTL) and make it the first class native Windows API framework replacing the aging MFC.,1
7496,Please release compiler SDK and tools for developing traditional desktop Windows API (and MFC and .net) application on ARM Windows RT devices.,1
7507,This capability is needed for third party apps also.,0
7535,Now since Cortana does this already please pass us the parsed NLP string with identified pronouns with grammatical breakdown.,1
7547,All localization should work like .resw files work - if there is no entry in the app description you should revert to the original entry.,1
7550,It would be great if windows phone will support access to contact´s groups.,1
7556,Allow a frame by frame capture from MediaCapture so that developers can more easily create streaming protocols without having to relay on the ugly and poorly documented Media Foundation API for trivial tasks.,1
7578,I had unlucky case that my app was refused by the tester though on his screenshot you can see that he got exact message on why the app is not working as it required proper text to speech to be installed.,0
7581,Bring back support for IPX/SPX or at the very least provide compatible drivers (either through the Microsoft Website or as a legacy feature) that can be installed on Windows 10.,1
7588,Currently need to generate a bitmap image which not works well for list etc,0
7589,Additional Payment option such as paypal should be added to allow people who owns visa card with advance features t register for Dev Center.,1
7591,Everything works well The button is visible and it says Choose File however if you click the button nothing happens.,0
7594,Please vote here to enable photo upload option in webview apps for windows phone,0
7651,Suggestion: Introduce a system with trusted developers who can release apps as quick and easy as it is now.,1
7672,Please create properties for disable Scrolling Pan and Zoom and Auto ressizing the webview.,1
7688,I'd like to see Windows API's Command Prompts File Explorer support a much longer file path.,1
7695,I feel that it is important to be able to minimize the CommandBar in Windows Phone apps because there is limited screenspace so even something like the CommandBar can make a difference.,1
7696,I like the ability for apps to connect to the people hub and show items in the news feed but there are some things that are really annoying to consumers and could be solved with a few APIs.,1
7699,I suggest some APIs for the app to attach some actions or commands to the item that the user can invoke straight from the people hub.,1
7708,1) It is cool that the Facebook app can show my news feed in the people hub but it's annoying the fact I have to go to the Facebook app to do something.,0
7709,I suggest some APIs for the app to attach some actions or commands to the item that the user can invoke straight from the… more,1
7710,We need a background task system event to update the wide tile (and the lock screen) message when the device wakes up (the lock screen becomes visible) on Windows Phone 8.1 (universal apps).,1
7720,Visual Studio should allow built-in GPU Programming for major brands (NVidia AMD and Intel),1
7730,I think the credentials needs to be deleted with the app uninstall.,1
7758,I would like to have an option to buy an app or a game and send it to my friend as a gift like I do on Steam.,1
7765,Please extend this to be the Maximum time that the Bluetooth spec allows between pings to maintain a connection (which is 32 seconds) or atleast make it greater than 6 seconds so that very low power Bluetooth devices can be made.,1
7787,Microsoft should include a good UI for the dashboard and to make some arrangement to display total downloads in the main page.like that of google Android dashboardthe windows developer dashboard is simply boring stuff,1
7788,I'd love to have better and improved reports to improve my app and tune the descriptions of my app store listings (ASO).,1
7789,For this I hope you could add the uninstall rate usage (how often how long a user uses my app) etc.,1
7795,Either allow to set a different password or remove the password of it like it was before in WP8.0.,1
7806,Show download percentage,1
7812,Please add a feature allowing developers to know the amount of remaining submission credits.,1
7816,It would also be nice if we could request those credits from the dev.center,1
7819,I also suggest that voice to text be allowed to write this,1
7827,There should be a Windows tool to convert android xliff strings to .resx format within the Windows phone sdk with support for mcc codes,1
7837,Enable Cortana on WP8.1,1
7839,Press the search key and enter Cortana's notebook by pressing the icon in the upper left corner of the screen.,0
7861,Allow more specific queries on Appointments.,1
7863,Platform should support new applications that are not big companies'.,1
7872,Also I'd like the rating of the app to allow me as the developer to respond back to the end user (ideally emailing them and or posting it online) And allow them to correspond with me to try and resolve any issues (whether that is with Microsoft being a proxy or whatever makes sense).,1
7890,I suggest to create another option that alternates lost of signal and bad signal.,1
7891,Create an infinite loop that breakes the connection in a random time.,1
7893,A an ability to the emulator that can emulate a bad data connection so we can discover performance problems before our clients receive it.,1
7896,Well I think that the devcenter app should be updated/extended so that the app can show the windows store apps as well as the phone apps (which it currently does) Ideally it should also use the live tiles to show the current stats on your apps.,1
7924,Suggestion: Show exactly that error message in the Windows Store dashboard.,1
7926,A single line should go through all the months regardless of the release or at least we should be able to turn that filter on or off.,1
7940,please send more information on app before removal of suspension.,1
7942,I am asking whoever checks or tests it put more information of their findings rather than giving the developers generic policy numbers like 1.1 or 3.6.,1
7946,When utilizing the File Picker and specifying one or more extensions the dialog that gets shown to the user should filter to these extensions not show everything but only have those items selectable.,1
7963,Let people inherit from EasingFunctionBase because Microsoft you do not have infinite wisdom and the predefined list of easing functions you give everyone doesn't have the one I need.,1
7977,Please expand your search range to at least the top 100-200 apps.,1
7980,Please update the Windows SDK and Windows App Certification Kit to allow us to use Win32 PrefetchVirtualMemory function: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh780543(v=vs.85).aspx,1
7987,I think that having and IAP price point of $0.49 could be wildly attractive to end users and get more purchases for developers.,1
7989,I'd like to be able to ping for nearby devices running an app using PeerfFinder but while the app is not in the foreground.,1
7991,Would it be practical to make it so that a user could authorize proximity tracking in the background so that an app could utilize it?,1
7993,make possible to add a range of list<mapicon> to make it faster and optimized,1
7994,Provide computer vision APIs that would allow developers to get access to functions such as motion tracking facial/gesture/voice recognition egomotion structures from motion and object identification etc.,1
7995,Pivot and panorama controls should have options to enable/disable wrapping.,1
7996,Also the scroll viewer should have options to disable overscrolling effect.,1
8000,Please cant we have an option in the WPAppManifest file to untick fast resume and allow WP8.1 apps to not run in fast resume mode just like in WP8?,1
8005,Microsoft should provide a better beta program for developers and user like the one in android in which you don't have to download a separate app  you update the stable one to the beta in the store.,1
8012,Allowing to prefetch an ad allow the developer to optimise his ad strategy.,1
8017,It will be useful if we can set the reminder tone to vibrate so that not every reminder would beep when you're in a meeting.,1
8018,At times you may want to set a reminder and let it vibrate in your pocket still giving only you a notification instead of beeping out loud when you don't want it to.,1
8029,For one of our products we need to support NFC card reading/writing with existing devices and several types of cards (Mifare UL ULC Calypso Desfire maybe even more),1
8037,VS2013 could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes (pages and user controls) from the original project.,1
8050,Please add recent places to SuggestedStartLocation in FileOpenPicker API.,1
8052,It would be much less frustrating for Windows/Windows Phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of Windows/ Windows Phone.,1
8074,Please implement the HttpListener class so that we can run REST based controls (similar to Xbox Smartglass) for our own apps?,1
8110,Let normal http:// URIs to be able to send notifications to the app using the window.external.notify and not only the https:// URIs.,1
8111,Give the power to the developer to decide if a page is allowed to use the ScriptNotify event or not!,1
8118,And my only wish is to format a DateTime like the user wants to see it.,1
8143,Please give us ability to run background agent and collect name of the current application in foreground.,1
8152,Could you please add programmiatic printing to the WinRT API?,1
8154,Under WPF it is possible to initiate printing to the default printer by simply calling Print() on a properly configured PrintDocument object.,0
8157,In order to print the guests must leave the tailored kiosk experience and interact with the local print dialog.,0
8162,While this is possible with CompositionSurface i feel it is needed on the Image Control as well.,1
8168,The Lockscreen text attribute should be separated out from Tile attributes.,1
8171,Could you please have a report that includes the prices before the final payment?,1
8174,We need more control over the device so childrens activities can be regulated.,1
8178,Once your app activates this mode users will not be able to see notifications access other apps or return to the Home screen until your app exits the mode.,0
8194,Make necessary conditions so that developers choose proper (representing application )high quality images as application symbols in store matching modern ui,1
8199,It would be good if we can at least optionally reduce the speed of the emulator to better reproduce real world devices.,1
8220,Technically everything went smoothly but when I tried to submit the update it required that I reserved a name.,0
8228,Please provide access to Calendar API to customize the day styles basing upon requirement,1
8237,I'd like a way to access the deviceExtendedProperties specifically the ANID2 in a Windows Store App.,1
8244,Everything is fine up until that point but if you want to serialize that class so that you can store it and load it directly instead of traversing the filesystem and opening up each file to read its ID3 tags every time you open the app (which can be a lot of unnecessary work especially for larger libraries) (or so you can send which book to play to an audio background task) you really don't have many options.,0
8249,My proposal is an API out of StorageFolder to retrieve a StorageItem given a relative path from that StorageFolder.,1
8298,My suggestion is that when a payment is being processed this should be indicated on the Financial report which include the expected date it will arrive and the exact amount being processed.,1
8299,I would suggest you look into AdMob/AdSense reporting for inspiration as it's very convenience and everything a developer want to know about payments is easily accessible.,1
8306,It would be nice to have such an API in WinRT so we don't have to resort to native DirectX each time we need something more than a couple of shapes.,1
8338,What I want is the ability to record those alongside system-provided ETW events so that I can see how my code's activity fits in with system behaviour.,1
8343,I would like to have better access to Lockscreen so that I can completely customize it which includes how the time is displayed any custom content like photos or news wallpaper.,1
8344,It should also allow a timer based updation.,1
8349,Obviously there should probably be a PIN requirement for first use/set up trust but the NFC capabilities of the WP platform will never be fully realized until a simple tap can make something happen without user interference.,1
8352,I think this is a bug because I think if the WriteableBitmap decides to update the PixelWidth and PixelHeight property it should also update the PixelBuffer or the data is inconsistent.,0
8358,make multitasking a real thing like seeing a video or having a mini calc when browse some thing.,1
8362,Live tiles are fine but we need a true way to make tiles more dynamic and that would be accomplished with a widget application template.,1
8363,In a similar way to the new lock-screen apps allow developers to create an app that runs inside a tile of larger dimensions that then current pre-defined tile sizes.,1
8364,The app should have full access to touch events on the tile so it can respond to them.,1
8374,Allow apps to act as data sources for other apps.,1
8375,Build on WCF to allow on-phone app-to-app communication.,1
8378,Allow JSON and/or XML to pass data between apps.,1
8381,Make apps request permission the first time they talk to a new app then let it happen in the background.,1
8385,We need IO Brokers to enable copy and paste scenarios in Universal App in Phone and tablet.,1
8387,We need real Background Download Broker so we can have torrent or custom Download scenarios (some of them may not apply to specific form factor),1
8395,We need Windows Phone to synchronize its clock via the internet.,1
8397,Include an API to add remove deactivate tracking protection lists (TPL) to further drive down data usage enable selective protection against rogue sites tracking and just having a sense of control.,1
8406,it is better if developers can start their app from background i mean one develops an app that has permission to start itself when it receives a notification.,1
8413,I understand power consumption is a consideration but a more balanced middle ground like only allowing more intensive background tasks when the system is plugged in and/or giving users clear indications such activity is occurring (liek Android does in its notification bar) so that they know why battery life is being impacted would make the WinRT environment much more useful and in turn drive adoption.,1
8426,It would be great for a permanently running app to have an API which notifies it when an update is available to notify when an update is forced to permit the app to check for an update easily and also to permit the app execute the update.,1
8438,Would become even more useful if say i could share to reading list from chrome extension or mac desktop or iOs.,1
8439,We need the PivotViewer control for WPF and WinRT please.,1
8441,I think that a wise addition would be to create a Universal search platform that when enabled a single tap on the Search button will bring up only a search bar and with that the user would search for content inside the app (and by content I'm talking specifically for app content).,1
8443,If I use this XAML definition it work but the groupheader is not wide as the listview.,0
8481,With MaxNumberOfColums you can limit the number of columns.,0
8489,Win8 applications need to be more productive for businesses!,0
8490,Allow XAML winRT apps to change the lock screen background.,1
8492,It would be much more comfortable to be able to read the entire notification in the center of notifications for wp8.1,1
8504,Be responsible and give more & specific details why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things.,1
8515,As with CSS it would be very useful if we could set text based framework elements to be UPPERCASE lowercase Title Case etc with a TextTransform property in Xaml.,1
8532,Please remove that validation or validate according with my tax plan and not my country in the account.,1
8556,The point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls.,1
8562,Please allow windows phone 8.1 file/folder picker to have access to onedrive and store the location in futureaccesslist.,1
8563,Also please allow onedrive folder to be stored locally like winrt.,1
8568,Because of windows 8.1 and windows phone 8.1 universal app I am hoping to adapt the app to windows phone as well.,1
8570,Make SD boot fresh each time phone is restarted or double files with nothing in them to play then error 80070057,1
8578,Prompt all users with a warning that they should make sure that the VPN is disabled before proceeding... including most users who have not enabled a VPN in the first place... and popping such a message almost every time the app is launched.,1
8580,Re-write large portions of code as native code and use the Winsock APIs instead of the WinRT.,1
8593,Make Bing Vision lens in the camera app pinnable to Start for quick access again and/or add it to the Cortana screen to the left of the Music Search button perhaps.,1
8595,Please add the From To options right after Download new email under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails.,1
8600,The Online Media extensibility is fantastic however it would be better if you allowed more sorting abilities for albums pictures and videos.,1
8604,It would be good if there was more sorting (either via the photo hub or via code) which allows all items to be sorted title\creation timestamp\last updated timestamp ascending\descending.,1
8606,Pleas allow in the WMappmanifest a selection box to force legacy resume mode so my WP81 app can function just as it did in WP8.,1
8611,However there should be more of swipe gestures than the tap methods.,1
8612,To set a difference a swipe to the right should launch 'settings' menu as a swipe to the left launches the 'apps list'.,1
8613,Plesae implement Windows.ApplicationModel.SuspendingDeferral as IDisposable (probably already declared in ISuspendingDeferral) and call method Complete() from within IDisposable.Dispose() to simplify its usage:,1
8614,Hey I thought it would be really useful if users could add a homepage to their Internet Explorer for their WP like they would on a desktop/PC,1
8617,IM apps could have custom keyboards or more fun ways of inputting data could be used.,1
8627,For security reasons I'd really like to see an option that if the high quality backup via wifi is enabled and if the phone is not currently connected to wifi then the phone automatically creates resized (smaller) photo and uploads it via data to the cloud and then delete's the resized photo from the phone.,1
8642,When you connect an iPhone to a mac you can view the webview from Safari by going to Develop->Debug.,0
8648,With frameworks like Angular Node jQuery etc becoming more popular we really need means to debug our apps to provide the best web experience.,1
8655,I would like to be able to pull in Bing news search results for a specified keyword,1
8657,Android has third-party apps that can block your apps/games with a password.,0
8662,I would like to get Short videos in fullscreen instead of picture on Lockscreen.,1
8665,I hope you like the idea i bet many people would like to have spinning earthwind blowingriver streamingwaterfallsetc on their lockscreen.,1
8681,Therefore if you want to detect horizontal swipe manipulations in a Vertical scrolling ScrollViewer (for a custom ListView Item horizontal sliding animation implementation for example) it simply cannot be done.,0
8695,In my opinion it is essential to have true multi-touch support for standard controls at least in Universal Applications.,1
8712,Please extend Song Class with more useful properties such as LastPlayedDate AddedDate.,1
8721,But why not allow it to be used locally by sideloading or through the emulators?,1
8731,It would be great if you would add a RemoteId to the calendars.,1
8748,I think there should be a casual genre section as a lot of apps don't fall into any specific section already listed.,1
8750,For example timer and alarm apps.,0
8755,It would be nice if more recent reviews would have more weight in the total score of the app.,1
8760,please make bookmarks for podcasts persistent after moving to another podcast and coming back.,1
8762,It would be nice to be able to render XAML that is not on the visual tree and perhaps in a background task.,1
8771,We should be able to use descriptive text overlays in our screenshots it allows us to better point out what the screenshot is showing.,1
8773,For some reason entering a number with a * at the front in to the dialler task in an app in WP7.5 WP8.0 or WP8.1 results in the message Please enter service codes directly from the phone's keypad.,0

8794,It would be cool to allow the ApplicationBar to have more icons available.,1
8796,It would be also cool to allow for more than one application bar per page so you could specify one at the top left bottom or right.,1
8807,When will the alarm feature be implemented in winrt to support the phone?,1
8808,It would be greater if we could disable the close function while doing important tasks like writing to the storage or similar.,1
8818,Please enable removing language code from the Dev Center language history,1
8830,It should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app 'language History' or an option to completly replace: Fully replace the prevoius(es) xap(s).,1
8865,Getting the Geolocator to actually do something requires getting the magical (and undocumented) setting of properties correct and then attaching event handlers,0
8885,It would be extremely helpful if the reminder/alarm API supported creating a reminder for specific days of the week.,1
8887,The trial feature should be built-in with automatic enforcement user prompting disabling etc just as it is in the Windows Store.,1
8891,Contrast this with the Windows Phone world where the developer indicates trial mode in the store but has to manually track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased etc.,0
8902,When submitting an app the store submission process should prompt you to link to documentation for any URI schemes your app includes in the manifest file or mark them as private URIs if you don't want to document them.,1
8904,Currently the best place to find documentation for URI schemes is the Nokia Dev Wiki http://bit.ly/NokiaUriSchemes but this information should really be available though Microsoft.,1
8909,Above could save hours spent on reading wrong answers,0
8929,There need to be a business app settings launcher native in the API.,1
8931,There must be a way to handle this kind of problem like statistics on how many times an app was started or not being able to start applications other than some basic apps.,1
8935,Currently (as of 8.1) when there is an embedded video in a WebView and the user presses the fullscreen button the video expands to only the extents of the WebView; which isn't fullscreen if the WebView is surrounded by other controls.,0
8936,There should be a property on the WebView that controls the fullscreen behavior such that it is possible to fill the entire viewable area of the display with the video and its controls.,1
8937,Have an API for an application to interact with and listen for incomming connections from paired bluetooth devices while in background.,1
8946,It will be very useful if user can scan custom QR code from other screen or poster from phone Search / Vision function and launch app via associated URI saved in QR code.,1
8953,An HTTP-based API with a program-friendly logon (e. g. OAuth) would be most welcome.,1
8955,There is no good reason for not allowing this so please add it.,0
8961,Everyone in the USA has nice upload speeds possibly but not worldwide and I presume Microsoft would wish to enable developers from other countries also to be able to use their dev center.,0
8962,Just remove the timeouts completely or at least increase all timeouts by a factor of at least 5 - its not a big deal to implement.,1
8971,To go 1 step further making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support system.,1
8972,Set up a brokerage system whereby the developer never sees the users live email address and instead replies to a proxy email set up per-user.,1
8995,Trial feature should be built-in with auto-prompted and disabling just like the Windows Store.,1
9011,is it possible to create a traffic counter that can show how many traffic I have by wifi or by gms (lte).,1
9014,the reminder function in the wp8 calendar must be expand to more weekly options.,1
9033,Similarly this idea could be thought through for integration of One Note with other Native applications like Camera Messaging etc,1
9035,It would be very useful to be able to prepair a MMSComposeTask in the same way that we today could use the SMSComposeTask .,1
9048,We would like to create an app to monitor the time users spend in other the apps enabling enterprise customers to optimize a user's day by analyzing time on applications.,0
9055,I would like to have an option for each SkyDrive folder to make them available offline.,1
9057,So those folders could be downloaded completely to the phone when a Wi-Fi is available to access them offline later.,0
9075,Windows should allow additional user accounts added to track & review the application review process similar to what Apple and Android apple stores allow.,1
9078,Please to have competitive advantage i would like you to provide an expedite package for app certification for developers who wants their apps to be published fast.,1
9092,Having users enroll their phone using the same mdm client no matter the vendor is a nice idea.,1
9095,Can we have an API to enroll the device through an app or allow mdm enrollment to initiate through a browser download.,1
9096,As a developer I would like to have method to defer app deactivation/suspending in order to call async methods easily,1
9101,If you are concerned about security reasons a good implementation of this API would be to always notify the user that a message from that application has been sent and where it was sent.,1
9112,We now need to add extra code to reposition it at the top after it has been loaded.,0
9120,I'd suggest to include all Transactions in the Report.,1
9123,All uesr want to find fast their contact when they must call so it's very good to insert the fast search on phone dialer it's good that the user can choose the better method to search like name or/and surname or/and Address etc...,1
9124,i think it's good that 3th apps can access to the list of installed apps and can decide to unistall or freeze or lock etc...,0
9125,Allow downloading of submissioned .xap files in Windows Phone application publish submission process.,1
9127,Please make kids corner as a another account.,1

9131,Allow debit cards as a payment instrument for registration and renewals,1
9143,Would be great to discover Service Hosts in local Networks.,1
9148,Provide an automation toolkit to enable developers to walk through a series of steps and take screenshots at relevant points then re-run those steps in different languages to automate the process of taking screenshots in different languages for app submission.,1
9149,Would also be helpful in it's own right for general localization testing to verify that localized strings have messed up layout.,1
9150,As a developer the only way to increase app ratings and review is to prompt user.,0
9157,I was expecting some notification center on the site so that i can see what new things have happened over my account since my last visit.,1
9159,Let me be able to see the reviews that are added or app crashes so that my attention towards them grows infinitely large.,1
9162,I want in WP8 back (it stiill works in WP7) that I can set a color for ApplicationBar Icons.,1
9186,isn't it better to allow developers to change their app name inside app store according to different language and culture?,1
9223,This would be very useful in the resource constrained environment of a phone.,0
9225,1) Allow more code to be shared across platforms and,1
9233,I would also be nice to be able to retain some kind of unique key the app could store or some other way the app can have a way to query 'to-do' items that the app created.,1
9236,A shared key chain to share data between the apps this help in apps with features like SSO,1
9237,Include support for pen input like on the surface pro and surface pro 2 for both WP8 and RT,1
9239,Make it possible to optionally declare a function OnClick() for live tiles such that this code is executed when the live tiles is presed without leaving the home screen.,1
9244,Allow the phone to be used as a mini presentation device.,1
9245,This can allow the phone to be used as a secondary display or project the screen contents on for example Push2TV devices or Widi Receivers,0
9271,Please Make it possible to build WP7 / 7.5 Apps :(,1
9279,The app should have more advanced options for scheduling when and how often it will run in the background perhaps by setting a different interval for different days of the week or times of the day or by specifying the time until it will run again each time it runs.,1
9280,Users should be given insight into how often an application is running in the background so they can decide which applications are worth allowing to process in the background and which aren't.,1
9282,Furthermore the 25 second duration should be expanded to at least 60 seconds to account for larger data transfers and slower network connections.,1
9293,This is also a capability that other mobile platforms have and I think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience.,0
9296,Apps should get at least 60 seconds of background processing time to complete such network transfers and process the response.,1
9308,In my opinion Chinese app are mainly design for Chinese and handsets are mostly from China Market.. Its may be challenging for developers to get phones from different countries or regions.,0
9310,Having said these I propose such feature of prompting to do a language pack installation to be on the Windows Phone OS level when user switches language.,1
9312,Having said these i thought a feature for prompting user installing language pack done on phone OS level would be good.,1
9318,Provide access to Playlist API to be able to create (auto) playlists based on the song library on the phone.,1
9320,If we use diferent datatemplates why not make every panel virtualizable?,1
9327,For example I would love it if my GPS app could turn location on when the app starts and turn it back off when the app exits.,1
9336,An developer should have an option or tool to manage that list and select which ones are displayed.,1
9348,Under this suggestion the developer should be unable to manage or modify the base/standard images this suggestion is only for adding additional images.,1
9349,The Windows Phone emulator should include the ability to manage VM snapshots for Windows Phone images.,1
9352,If you want to load content after you reach the end of a list you have to write your own user control or create data bindings.,0
9354,If NavigationService.Navigate() would let us pass a parameter of type object along with the URI it will help us to keep less states objects in the App class which will become a mess as project grows.,1
9358,Please provide a PhotoCropTask that takes an Image(Byte[]) and provides the same crop tool.,1
9359,Include a PixelHeight and PixelWidth as optional parameters so an aspect ratio can be included.,1
9360,This would allow for Picture cropping.,0
9363,Provide an API(s) that allow apps to either control Settings (eg being able to toggle WiFi when NFC tag is interacted).,1
9364,Also it would be nice if there was an API that allowed an app to be integrated into the Settings Applets instead of a standard app.,1
9374,I'd like to see the Windows App store be similar to Google where I can skip the hassle and headache of certification and just get an app on the store in hours not days.,1
9384,Allow us developers to renew our expired subscriptions.,1
9386,I've asked the support they said me that I have to create another subscription with another live account and after it ask them to migrate apps and related data.,0
9398,It's not healthy to keep several accounts that means nothing specially ones that you just had to create because you need to renew the subscription,0
9413,Please provide any idea about background service in wm8 as gps tracking automatically.,1
9416,If Windows Phone as any faith in its future it needs a lot more support from the development team.,0
9424,If you want people to develop apps you need to offer a dev platform that doesn't only run on the latest and greatest machines.,1
9426,We miss a control like the integrated photo viewer to show photos or any controls page by page by using flick gestures.,1
9437,It should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app 'language History'.,1
9440, - You can publish an update with the removed ru language but this update will not fully replace the old version and you will in truble.,0
9473,I think Placement should be splitted in HorizontalPlacement (Left Center Right) and VerticalPlacement (Top Bottom) to have more flexibility.,1
9481,I would like to have a reminder system (API) that allows me to know if the phone is near a phone from a friend (location based).,1
9482,Example: Remind me to ask Holly about the project status when I meet her the next time.,0
9489,I think this will be the wrong way.,0
9492, I am a professional software engineer and I am developing with Visual Studio at work So I thougt its a goot idea to buy a windows phone because I could develop some phone applications.,0
9497,It would be very convenient to just click a button and have your app placed in only the markets that we do not need to worry about taxes.,1
9518,Since changing is not an option you will need to create a new account within the Turkey region.,0
9522,Since you have mentioned that you are a student account this might require you to create to simultaneous accounts.,0
9525,Note that if you have a Store account the apps from that side will not transfer.,0
9537,It would be great if there were specific classes that could be instantiated on non-ui threads (and then loaded by ui-thread image objects),1
9542,This would be very useful in determining why sometimes upload is slow,0
9543,Mark sideloaded apps in app list so one can differentiate an in-store app from a side loaded version that's in development.,1
9546,Like surface pro implementing the pressure layer pen on wp8 and win RT,0
1567,Convert EXE to APPX by command lines?,0
1571,It's 21 century.,0
1572,I know that text boxes can be customized easily.,0
1573,But the UWP textboxes are not that god when it comes to numeric input.,0
1574,I'm currently working on a software that has a lot of numeric input.,0
1578,Only allows numeric input,0
1587,Format numbers with commas on thousands (i.e.,0
1591,If the user enters a value less than the min value the value will be updated to min value on lost focus.,0
1610,Notice that Intellisense suggests Test for the bind path,0
1613,The same with old stlye Binding works fine,0
1614,Comparison results with Edge on the right:,0
1618,App tested is WebView Release.,0
1619,Tried both WebViewExecutionMode.SeparateThread,0
1621,Even rendering on separate thread will block UI thread (for example Reveal highlight effect while bigger page is loading or typing into TextBox will lag while javascript in the page is running),0
1623,Currently it is impossible to implement context menus save files and implement other functions general web browsers have.,0
1627,Every modern operating system on this planet uses LF style line endings except for Windows which still writes one more useless byte at every end of a line.,0
1628,It is time for a change!,0
1648,What can i do?,0
1649,My Windows is Version 1709 Build 16299.19.,0
1664,Something in both Silverlight and WPF but missing from UWP - Tiled brushes!,0
1665,(Although curiously TileBrush is still the base class for brushes... just without tiling :'( ),0
1666,This will allow use of tiled images (and perhaps videos) for use as brushes anywhere a XAML Brush is accepted - like Backgrounds Text foregrounds Path fills etc.,0
1667,I want my UWP UI to look the same across any screen of the same resolution regardless of the scale factor applied by Windows.,0
1668,For instance when running my app on the Hololens it applies a 150% scale factor.,0
1669,This means the UI looks squished when compare to a desktop screen of a similar resolution (1280x720).,0
1671,Can this be implemented for the Hololens?,0
1674,There are situations where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page when using NavigationView.,0
1675,Say you throw up a message box a la Do you want to save the changes Yes/No/Cancel if you were to click Cancel there's no way to prevent the NavigationView to follow through with it visually.,0
1676,Say you have two menu items one Home and the other Whatever.,0
1678,There's no sane way to do it e.g.,0
1679,a Cancel boolean on the event args of the ItemInvoked event.,0
1680,An example for this would be this budgeting app I'm currently working on.,0
1681,If you're editing a transaction but haven't committed it trying to navigate away I'd like to throw up a Save Changes?,0
1682,message box with the typical Yes/No/Cancel options.,0
1683,I can't deal with the Cancel action without code voodoo trying to revert the SelectedItem ASAP.,0
1684,Thanks for considering changing this.,0
1690,In my opinion UWP is too much APP centric.,0
1691,We are spending (and loosing) a great amount of time working around trying to do simple things (like pass command line arguments.. write on folders .. trying to execute another program ..).,0
1694,OS information is not included at all on the 'Usage' page.,0
1695,While I get crashes by OS (Health page) I need to cross-reference this with usage by OS to determine the overall impact of a given bug.,0
1698,We are currently developing for desktop-only screens (we have control over the device types) and want to prevent users from sizing the window smaller than 992px x 700px.,0
1699,This application is far too complex for mobile screens and 500 x 500 is too small.,0
1700,Is this an option we can hope for in the near future?,0
1702,The default MenuFlyoutSubItem allows you to add subitems either through XAML or the Items code behind property.,0
1704,I'm currently trying to convert an application that contains some of the CoreUtils utilities (most notably [.exe and ].exe).,0
1705,This fails abruptly at Preparing Virtual File System,0
1707,VERBOSE: Begin Convert-Files...,0
1708,VERBOSE: Renaming 'Files' directory to 'VFS'...,0

1725,System.Management.Automation.WildcardPatternException: The specified wildcard character pattern is  at System.Management.Automation.WildcardPattern.IsMatch(String input),0
1784,Looking at the VfsOps.ps1 file it seems that the Test-Path on line 138 assumes that the file path is a standard wildcard not a file name.,0
1785,Looks like it could be fixed by adding [Management.Automation.WildcardPattern]::Escape(...) somewhere but I haven't been able to find out how to make the catalog writeable so that I can test this...,0
1789,When running through C++ Code Analysis projects using ATL will minimally hit the following atlcom.h warnings:,0
1791,Buffer overrun while writing to 'm_pDACL': the writable size is 'pDACL->AclSize' bytes but '8' bytes might be written.,0
1795,Buffer overrun while writing to 'newACL': the writable size is 'aclSize' bytes but '8' bytes might be written.,0
1798,Orbit View Currently have 2D plane so for Mixed Reality Apps third Dimension needed to expand it functionality.,0
1799,Like for example for Space apps where Earth have satellites NEO and space stations and they all have orbits based on earth so orbital view in 3D make it better in Mixed reality,0
1804,Is there some sort of bug tracker for Microsoft software?,0
1805,Kinda like UserVoice but for bug reports?,0
1806,I have an app that works normally but when launched via the Desktop Bridge there's some strange issues with COM.,0
1807,What does the Desktop Bridge do differently?,0
1810,CoreApplication now has a RequestRestartAsync method but it fails in a Desktop Bridge app with NotInForeground.,0
1813,I wonder if this is because of the way the Desktop Bridge technology wraps the WPF application.,0
1814,Any ideas on how I can cause the app to restart?,0
1816,However collapsing a pivot item does not remove it from the UI visual tree.,0
1817,The header still 'exists' and is keyboard focus-able.,0
1818,Since you can correctly hide ListBoxItems I'm considering this a bug.,0
1820,Repeatedly calling MediaPlayer.StepForwardOneFrame() `MediaPlayer.StepBackOneFrame() should switch between two frames but video is moving slightly back.,0
1821,Repository on github: https://github.com/tesar-tech/MediaPlayerFrameMoveInconsistentBehavior,0
1823,At first this isn't an issue since the control isn't Visible.,0
1824,However if you make the parent visible binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear.,0
1825,This was probably done as a performance optimization; however binding needs to recognize visibility changes if it won't bind when an item is not visible in the UI.,0
1826,Otherwise yet again MVVM is broken.,0
1827,I have a UWP UserControl line chart that renders a PathFigure to a Canvas.,0
1828,This chart supports zooming and the PathFigure size is changed during zoom but clipped within the visible Chart area.,0
1829,At high zoom levels (above 300%) the entire UWP app will crash with a native exception: An unhandled win32 exception occured in <app> [17800],0
1831,There must be a bug some place in the framework.,0
1832,This crash only happens using the Fall Creators Update after the clipping issue was fixed.,0
1833,I'm guessing it's a numerical overflow somewhere deep in the graphics stack.,0
1837,From my viewpoint I think there is no way in managed code I should be getting a native exception like this.,0
1840,The following Hyper-V networking Configuration breaks DNS name resolution on the Virtual Machine:,0
1842,Connecting the host to a non-corporate (remote) WiFi network.,0
1847,When a VM is connected to the default switch and the host is connected to the corporate network via Cisco AnyConnect the VM looses the ability to resolve DNS addresses.,0
1848,The VM is able to ping both public addresses and corporate addresses; however it is unable to resolve names on either the public internet or corporate network.,0
1849,This issue was submitted as a MS Premier support ticket (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/commercial/incidents/117111417156306) and a Connect bug (https://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/feedback/details/3142497/build-16299-15-hyper-v-default-switch-nat-name-resolution-not-working).,0
1850,Was advised by Premier that this is an architectural issue.,0
1857,Start a VM and connect it to the Default Switch (NAT),0
1862,Using the fall creator's update version of UWP it seems that when a data context is changed to a new view model the previous view model is updated with null values.,0
1863,This is the same as if the DataContext is set to null before changing view models.,0
1864,It doesn't make sense why the bound values are updated when the DataContext is changed.,0
1867,In stack overflow or any other forums we have option to add multiple tags related to our question.,0
1868,Currently is not possibile to create a new Calendar inside an Enterprise Exchange user account.,0
1869,It's only allowed to create an app calendar which lives on local device,0
1871,The Windows.Services.Store namespace does not provide a class that you can use to simulate license info during testing.,0
1874,At the moment a VSTO add-in cannot be published on Windows Store or on Office Store.,0
1875,An idea could be extending Desktop App Converter tool in order to manage VSTO add-in.,1
1877,I reported that since studio 15.4.3 the designer crash due to attached properties,0
1881,Changing to last UWP solve the designer problem; but the attached properties are not working (the binding) and I have to do set binding by code,0
1888,While understandable that there are big challenges to overcome to make this possible but currently the bar to create optional packages is too high due that the time investment and issues that can occur makes it not that worh it due the C++ requirement.,0
1892,The CreateStreamedFileAsync() method is there since Windows 8 to delay creation of file data.,0
1893,However when using the result in a Drag+Drop or Clipboard operation Windows Explorer errors out with 0x80004002 No such interface supported.,0
1894,It can be used between UWP apps but not in Windows Explorer which really is a shame.,0
1895,There are desktop Win32 APIs for delay creation of files that are used heavily e.g.,0
1896,in WinZIP and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in UWP.,0
1897,Please support the UWP equivalent called CreateStreamedFileAsync in Windows Explorer!,1
1899,Things like MinConnectionInterval MaxConnectionInterval SlaveLatency and Connection Supervisory Timeout,0
1901,It is a compendium of various PDF viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control.,0
1902,I have no doubt it could be improved by community involvement.,0
1905,The documentation may be found here:,0
1909,An given example of the API can be seen below:,0
1919,Under UWP it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox.,0
1920,Even to suggest a path is not possible.,0
1921,So your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a path-string.,0
1922,So at the moment i have to tell my customers: open the folder-picker and navigate from the pictures-library to the path:D:\very long path..\final_folder.,0
1923,and thereby... the folderpicker has no preview to the content in a folder.,0
1925,actual implementing an selection of file or folder in UWP (how easy but stupid),0
1932,so picker.SuggestedStartLocation is not a string to a path but only a selection of libraries.,0
1933,does microsoft really believe that users and developers accept that lowest budget setup?,0
1934,now after the great Windows 10 Fall Creators Update it is still a joke to switch and develop to UWP.,0
1936,does anybody at MS have an idea how to propose an path in an UWP application?,0
1943,We'll currently I have a Uwp app that needs to call a web.api service that is secured with azure ad.,0
1944,I have been looking for samples and tutorials to do this and I have found some.,0
1945,But they all differ in what to do exactly.,0
1955,I have created AppPinManager helper class  just call those helper fuunction  it will takecare to add into the startmenu or TaskBar,0
1959,For example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes.,0
1961,Currently UWP Community Toolkit includes seven services that are very useful but more is always better it would be awesome to add more and more services including a big one for a lot of people WordPress.,1
1964,To clarify that this can be done from Windows 10 as a part of Windows administration and configuration for instance via Group Policies PowerShell Windows Updates Schedule Tasks etc.,0
1972,There are several issues with the file activation NeighboringFilesQuery argument and the file system indexer.,0
1974,If files are loaded using the NeighboringFilesQuery then GetPropertiesAsync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed.,0
1975,This prevents reading things like altitude from the GPS location data.,0
1977,The above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled (right click on the drive in Explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom) which used to be recommended for SSD drives.,0
1978,In particular no ImageProperties are available in this case.,0
1979,It also happens if the indexer isn't working properly (which is not uncommon).,0
1981,If the indexer is really broken (for some reason this started happening on my PC so is not uncommon) then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all (confirmed by using the default Photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo).,0
1984,I don't think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable.,0
1997,This will enable automatic testing on hybrid windows apps where DOM inspection is necessary.,0
1998,When setting ToolTipService.Placement to Mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp.,0
1999,It looks like the tooltip is not perfectly aligned to the device pixels but rather half a pixel off vertically.,0
2000,This is on Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (build 16299.19) @ 150% DPI scale the app targets Windows 10 SDK 16299.,0
2003,Would be a lot more intuitive useful and less distractive then the current overlay.,0
2006,The way ink Input is currently handled is sooo Win32 ;) I know there is InkCanvas and Windows.UI.Input.Inking.Analysis put this should be build into the text controls in a standard way.,0
2009,Imagine writing text directly into the TextBox or RichEditBox canvas without the Ink-Keyboard-Overlay.,1
2015,It limits the use case of MasterView.,0
2016,We can't use Pivot Semantic Zoom GridView PullToRefresh SlidableListItem and more.,0
2018,Don't fake the page navigation using Storyboard.,0
2019,Then devs can use Connected Animations.,0
2020,I upgraded to the latest VS 2017 and change my UWP app to use .Net.Native 2.0.,0
2021,It now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by Microsoft components.,0
2025,Calling this method would throw exception at runtime.,0
2027,If for some reason your P/Invoke does not satisfy those requirements please use [DllImport(ExactSpelling=true) to indicate that you understand the implications of using non-UWP APIs,1
2029,I don't call this function.,0
2030,When I traced down some new crashes I found that Socket.ConnectAsync is trying to call this function and failing because it doesn't exist.,0
2031,I have about 15-20 similar errors in the build that are referencing things I don't directly call.,0
2032,I've reverted to .Net.Native 1.7 until this gets fixed.,0
2044,In Windows Forms toolkit there is a handy control called the NumericUpDownControl.,0
2062,Current appextension only supports loading assets and scripts.,1
2063,In many scenarios 3rd party author may provide some code actable with the main app for example decoding another file format.,1
2064,There may be trusting problems.,0
2065,If you change the DataPackageOperation to Copy the problem goes away.,0
2067,We are experiencing an issue where the presence of a PasswordBox with a NumericPin InputScope overrides the InputScope of other controls on the page--until the PasswordBox has received focus.,0
2068,On a touch screen this manifests every time a user reaches the first page in our UWP App that has a NumericPin-scoped PasswordBox.,0
2072,3) Build and run the app,0
2074,5) See that the touch keyboard is the NumericPin keyboard even though the focused TextBox should have the default InputScope.,0
2075,6) Click into TextBox 2.,0
2078,Keyboard remains NumericPin.,0
2080,10) See that the InputScopes of the TextBoxes are now honored.,0
2094,2) Add the XAML below to MainPage.xaml,0
2096,4) Before doing anything else click the Show touch keyboard button in the notification tray such that the touch keyboard appears.,0
2098,I think I found a problem in Media Player.,0
2099,The problem happens on phone if media player is paused from another media app.,0
2100,In this case will be fired only MediaPlayer.PlaybackSession.PlaybackStateChanged event and it is not possible to detect whether app was paused through user or system.,0
2101,But if phone calls then will be simulated SystemMediaTransportControls pause button click (MediaPlayer.SystemMediaTransportControls.ButtonPressed event) and on phone call I can correctly stop my player and change some states.,0
2106,I am preloading images for speed and I need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling GC.Collect() immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory.,0
2107,I've looked into using a SoftwareBitmapSource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and I'm not 100% sure whether its Dispose method works (doesn't affect memory shown in VS debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator).,0
2111,Compact overlay window is always shown at the right-top corner.,0
2114,Conditional check doesn't actually solve the problem it doesn't suit the control like NavigationView since at the end developer still have to create a NavigationView with SplitView which is really pain to maintain.,0
2117,More details can be found in this issue https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs/issues/150,0
2119,We can see the support of communities in UWPCommunityToolkit.,0
2121,As a self-learner it is very hard to find a tutorial to learn new things.,0
2122,MapControl has some nice extensibility options but requires specifying a token even if you're using local or custom tile sources as the background replacement layer.,0
2124,I hear a lot about “clean uninstall” but we noticed a few months ago appx leaves some stuff behind.,0
2125,Specifically persisted appframe window sizing data remains behind potentially leaving the user/dev in a potential bad or confusing window state.,0
2126,See the data piling up in the following stores:,0
2130,A lot of small time developers like myself don't have the means to use the Microsoft Store to host their apps.,0
2131,I develop applications for the military and the IT department barely has any idea what they're doing.,0
2133,Win32 apps still dominate because they're so robust and developed.,0
2134,To bring in new and old developers bring back the same functionality that is found in WPF and Winforms.,0
2140,Assume the following XAML: and not calling SetDesiredBounds!,0
2154,This is what the screen looks like: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwcFjitFI7iNTXl5A,0
2155,(sorry for the photo could not do a regular screen shot at the moment!),0
2156,Looks good?,0
2157,Yes video and transport controls cover the entire media player!,0
2159,In full screen transport controls (not video) do also respect the safe area.,0
2164,Otherwise this looks cut and incomplete.,0
2165,Nevertheless so far this is ok and could be called as expected.,0
2166,So far so good.,0
2167,Now let's turn on DesiredBoundsMode.,0
2169,The safe area is removed... and it looks like the following: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwdhtSgx38PFkcWeQ,0
2171,Page has no more safe area BUT on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area even though the media player is part WITHIN the page.,0
2172,(For full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot) Why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video?,0
2174,That's an real issue.,0
2175,I am removing the safe area by calling SetDesiredBounds and I am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page.,0
2177,I debugged this a lot and found a solution (and realized a very dirty hack by Microsoft):,0
2178,In my app I am using custom transport controls and I used the original template as a starting point.,0
2179,I found out that there is a <grid> element with x:name=ControlPanelGrid and on Xbox it gets magically a margin of 4804827,0
2180,This is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above.,0
2181,Removing the x:name or renaming that element is enough the margin is gone.,0
2182,Nevertheless I would expect a less hacky solution.,0
2184,Having a safe-area within a media element's transport controls when not full-screen is definitely a bug.,0
2185,And fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with it's name is not present.,0
2197,The MediaPlayerElement supports various subtitle formats.,0
2198,But when we play a video file using MediaStreamSource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create MediaStreamDescriptors for them.,0
2199,So audio and video works but subtitles don't work.,0
2201,This would be very helpful to make the MS initiated FFmpegInterop truly unviersally useful.,0
2202,I am unable to use containers and VmWare/VirtualBox on Windows 10 at the same time due to the restriction of Hyper-V.,0
2203,This restriction does not exist on Linux and MacOS.,0
2204,Why force me to reboot to disable/enable Hyper-V?,0
2205,Why does Hyper-V lock out other virtualization software?,0
2206,The WPF UniformGrid (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.primitives.uniformgrid(v=vs.110).aspx) is missing in UWP.,0
2207,It doesn't seem to quite have an equivalent in UWP in order to get even spacing of a grid automatically as well as other features like setting rows/columns and first column for calendar type applications.,0
2209,We need this so we can directly start searches within Cortana from our apps.,0
2213,1) Camera app using display as a flash to light-up when using front facing camera.,0
2216,A previous uservoice API to control screen brightness https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/2359006-api-to-control-screen-brightness was marked closed after Creators update with Brightness control being introduced.,0
2217,BrightnessOverride would fit the purpose except it requires IoT / Embedded mode and therefore cannot use this API.,0
2221,2) Clock app to control the brightness of display at night time,0
2226,Apple announced support for Fragmented MP4 backed HLS Streams under HLS version 7: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/504/ at WWDC 2016.,0
2227,We are looking to change the way our HLS streams are generated and Windows seems to be one of the few platforms that doesn't support playing these type of streams.,0
2231,I have to make a stub of the class in the local project which causes duplicate of code.,0
2232,I submitted this to the VS forum but they said to post the issue here.,0
2234,if the <DataTemplate x:DataType=models:LocalStatus> references POCO class that is in a seperate project the XAML will not compile.,0
2239,We now have this option for ListView and GridView but not for the ComboBox control.,0
2241,The StreamSocket class has no good way of polling the connection status without sending data (your connection may have died minutes ago but you won't know until you try to send something which isn't desirable).,0
2242,Many of the old implementations in .Net and even in VB6 socket control had this functionality (and it was highly useful).,0
2243,The proposal is to add something like:  // Something happened update your UI or run your business logic,1
2248,While downloading a file with BackgroundDownloader the progress updates every 1MB which is not really accurate.,0
2249,I've noticed that pausing and resuming the download accelerates the update rate to about every 250 ms.,0
2251,This would allow us to easily use different ItemTemplates for each group in conjunction with GroupStyleSelector.,0
2252,There are many cases where you have different kind of data and group them by data type.,0
2254,imagine a image viewer where you have one group Folders and one group Images.,0
2256,Or you display search results for various item types in one view.,0
2257,It is possiblte to achieve this right now using the normal ItemTemplateSelector on ListView/GridView.,0
2258,But it causes a context switch from native->.net and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items (this is noticeable on slow devices or phones).,0
2259,Plus as I read in the docs this can degrade virtualization performace as the control does not know upfront which items need which template.,0
2261,Now the control does not need to call selector for every item speeding up the control.,0
2271,'m writing this feedback in Desktop Bridge because I think this team is the innovative and will do a better job of communicating these problems to Windows Store team.,0
2272,Desktop Bridge attracts me as a developer but Windows Store puts me off.,0
2274,Currently the only way to find programs are if you type their names.,0
2275,There are no keyword searches.,0
2277,This has been like that for many years but no one has done anything about it.,0
2278,If you wonder why developers are not jumping on to something as attractive as Desktop Bridge this is the reason.,0
2281,There are many threads on Internet discussing this issue but Windows Store team doesn't seem to listen.,0
2292,Otherwise the private store can only be used for in-house apps or free apps.,0
2293,A content control that enables the user to use inking to enter text in TextBoxes (including RichEditBox),0
2295,Each JavaScript app that uses a Video element in the UI and calls the play() function to stream the video preview from camera to the app page will Crash after recent Windows 10 update 10.0.15063.608,0
2300,This crash occurs in all JavaScript apps that use the MediaCapture API to display camera Video previews.,0
2301,For this reason apps programmed in JavaScript that use Video or photo capturing are from now on non-functional in Windows 10.,0
2302,According to the documentation it is possible to x:Bind events to a handler.,0
2308,When working with parameters this works as long as the parameters have the default names.,0
2309,So for the CalendarView.SelectedDatesChanged event the following signature works:,0
2314,This behavior is not found in public documentation.,0
2327,But I couldn't find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality.,0
2328,In DX11 you can't read and write to the same texture and that's fine I can live with that.,0
2329,However the API was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario.,0
2331,These objects are semi-transparent (alpha-blending) so I need to draw them sorted by distance to camera (back to front) and not by state changes.,0
2332,Let's assume I have 50 objects which are Soft Particles (SP),0
2333,And 50 objects that are triangle meshes (TM),0
2334,Both SP and TM use alpha blending.,0
2335,SP don't do depth writes but they do depth-tests and depth reads in the shader.,0
2337,TM do depth writes and depth tests but they don't do depth reads in the shader.,0
2338,By depth writes I mean the D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC.DepthWriteMask,0
2339,So both SP and TM do legal operations (they don't write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time),0
2340,However in the worst case when SP and TM are ordered in the following way:,0
2342,I have to change the depth stencil view using OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call to set the same depth texture but with view that has D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH enabled or disabled.,0
2344,So in order to draw them all I have to do:,0
2350,To my understanding OMSetRenderTargets is a slow operation but I need to call it 100 times.,0
2351,And the calls to OMSetRenderTargets are really useless because the same depth texture is used just with a different view and because both SP and TM do legal operations they don't write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time.,0
2357,-I don't need to create 2 depth stencil views for each depth buffer (one with D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH enabled and one with disabled),0
2358,-I don't need to call OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call where I want to change D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH.,0
2359,But I just stick to normal depth writes D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC.DepthWriteMask,0
2361,This artificial limitation is also the cause for bugs in WebGL 2 in Chrome/FireFox:,0
2363,Once you start working on WebGL 2 in MS Edge you will notice that you will encounter the same problem because in GLES3/WebGL2 it's legal to read from the depth texture while it's bound to the FBO and you will have to do checks for each draw call if depth stencil view needs to be changed to have D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH or no.,0
2368,Say I have 100 objects to draw.,0
2373,SP don't do depth writes but they do depth-tests… more,0
2375,See GitHub issue for more information and scenarios (https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs/issues/239),0
2377,it's extremely annoying when I face service issues with devcenter with no knowledge if they are investigated or not.,0
2378,I don't want all the time contact support wait wait wait and yeah we have issues or now is just Saturday...I've to wait til Monday?,0
2379,With service issue I mean devcenter backend is down or doesn't work properly in some ways.,0
2381,At least we're not totally in the dark in a limbo where we don't know if the issue is just a transient one or a serious one and we have to way days.,0
2390,MapControl crashing whole App with the following stacktrace:,0
2391,Please conntact me for a code to reproduce this crash.,0
2393,This would allow the app to process messages asynchronously without pairing.,0
2394,Some devices/apps do not have the ability of input (pairing/password).,0
2395,The main impediments when creating a Chat-like control using a ListView is that we don't have a native way to handle incrementalLoading at the top of list.,0
2396,There is already an example we can reuse in UWP samples https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/XamlBottomUpList,1
2398,Wanted to use /list to work on automating the installer for a container image and there's a ****** check in place that blocks this scenario because the SDK is already installed.,0
2401,Download Windows SDK on a machine with Windows SDK installed,0
2406,The WebView control doesn't allow printing embedded PDFs etc.,0
2408,If it works in Edge Chrome and Firefox it should work in WebView control.,0
2409,Not sure why even having a web browser control if it isn't going to have full browser features (minus the tabs settings URL input box etc.,0
2411,Since Edge doesn't support lockdown usage (like IE did with Kiosk mode) it makes it even more important to have this.,0
2412,I add a CustomAudioEffect which is EQ (I've also tried using official UWP sample's EchoEffect) to MediaPlayer.,0
2413,Although it seems CustomAudioEffect is running on Worker thread not UI thread it seems media playback would also be impact when UI loading a bit heavier.,0
2414,I could hear my music become intermittently.,0
2417,Now that Xaml and DirectX support SVG images I'd love to provide my splash screen image as an SVG file.,1
2420,So often the png splash screen is larger than all of the app's compiled code.,0
2421,(I'd also be OK using a Xaml Path.),0
2425,Apple has such a form and on the few occasions that I've needed to use it they've generally completed a review in a few hours.,0
2426,This is useful for situations where a critical security flaw is identified or where a trade show or other immovable deadline requires an app get through the review process more quickly than usual.,0
2427,I found a similar suggestion made back in 2011 which was closed when the certification expectation time was lowered to three days.,0
2428,Three days is not fast enough for many common scenarios.,0

2438,The current USB API is lacking the ability to specify which USB Port Number to use rather than the device VendorID/ProductID.,0
2440,I have two identical USB Zebra printers and cannot tell them apart.,0
2442,The current support for Bluetooth LE in Win10 Creators Update does not allow publishing of an Eddystone beacon ( https://developers.google.com/beacons/eddystone ) because the api reserves the use of many data section types.,0
2443,This limits the capability of the btle publishing api to manufacturer specific payloads.,0
2447,The closet option is to launch it FullScreen but that obscures the task bar.,0
2448,Auto give little control over the first launch of the app.,0
2449,This meant that I ended up using PreferredLaunchViewSize during first launch and then Auto on subsequent launches.,0
2450,This is what I am currently using ApplicationViewWindowingMode.Auto : ApplicationViewWindowingMode.PreferredLaunchViewSize;,0
2461,This seems a bad way to manage window size.,0
2471,This is what I am currently using,0
2483,BUG: Setting PreferredLaunchWindowingMode before PreferredLaunchViewSize is set results in undefined behavior,0
2490,BUG: PreferredLaunchViewSize must be 500x320 or higher at first launch (assuming 100% scale size).,0

2516,Master-Detail with x:Bind is not working properly.,0
2517,When you use x:Bind to bind a TextBox to a property of the SelectedItem of a ListView this problem exists:,0
2519,2. you select a new item in the listView,0
2521,Your changes from 1 are lost because the selection in the ListView changes before the LostFocus-event of the TextBox was raised.,0
2522,That means the change was never written back to the original item.,0
2523,This bug more description and the code to reproduce it can be found in this blogpost:,0
2526,The UpdateTask or PreConfigurationTask capabilities are good examples.,0
2529, As its very inconvenient to have to wait for 5 business days to have a response and you may need to have your app on the store in less time depending on an urgency which I have due to needing to have my app passed for one of my love ones who have passed away.,0

2538,Attempting to utilize the Windows UCRT SDK (...\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.15063.0\ucrt) to evaluate Clang on Windows I was immediately facing an unexpected wall in the form of an undisclosed and unexpected dependency on Microsoft's Visual Studio.,0
2539,Apparently even the simplest C program will not be able to compile (as soon as you include any standard C header) because they all seem to end-up attempting to #include <vcruntime.h> (which is not part of the UCRT).,0
2542,Is there a way to utilize the Windows Universal C RTL SDK withOUT Visual Studio?,0
2544,If it is not intended why then is it not called Windows CRT for Microsoft VC - what am I missing and is it really legal/appropriate?,0
2553,For instance if I have a slider using doubles with a range of [0.5 3.0] with a TickFrequency of 1 then I see tick marks at 0.51.5 and 2.5.,0

2558,The ComboBox now automatically has the infinite scrolling behavior when lots of items are present.,0
2559,This is confusing for users as they are seeing the same items multiple times.,0
2560,The ComboBox uses the CarouselPanel but this does not have the option to disable circular scrolling either.,0
2561,My app contains a CalendarView component.,0
2562,The user opens the app looks at the CalendarView with today highlighted and lets the app run into the next day.,0
2563,The user looks at the CalendarView the today highlight doesn't update and therefore shows yesterday's date as today,0
2566,As well as a return Method that allows you to return to the Dialog before it after the new Dialog has run such as if you want a returning Password Entry or something.,0
2574,I'm considering rewriting it as a Queue for Dialogs as currently it will only display one Dialog and queue one dialog meaning if you try to queue two it will fail.,0
2575,This is a Helper to ensure Safe handling of Content Dialogs This will help prevent exceptions from trying to open a Content Dialog when one is already open.,0
2576,Methods involve Async and Non Async opening (If you want the result or not) These methods have a Boolean that lets you specify whether you want to wait for the Dialog before it to close before showing it so you can show break through Dialogs such as Error or Password Prompts.,0

2586,The image control only supports BGRA8 encoding and the Win2d Control’s supported type is also determined by BitmapPixelFormat.,0
2587,They are very unfriendly to Machine Vision developers.,0

2616,The site is faster in Chrome and IE but still not fast and gives a poor user experience due to the lack of performance.,0
2618,Currently it is at risk of giving the impression of being neglected and not prioritized.,0

2630,The Acquisitions Funnel in the new Windows Developer Center dashboard is cool but the rectangular bars representing each stage of the funnel are incorrect.,0
2631,For example I have a 25% conversion rate between Store page views and downloads but the second bar is only 5% the width of the first bar (should be ~25%).,0

2669,(Note that this is not ECDSA; the use of elliptic curve keys in a signature mode),0
2672,Which situation am I in?,0
2673,1) I missed the documentation that explained how to do this.,0
2674,2) Universal Windows Apps just can't do this and never will.,0
2675,3) A later release will let me do this?,0
2691,When adding (or removing) a lot of items we suspend the events and will raise a *single* event for all the items that were changed during the suspension period.,0
2693,Before recent changes we were (ab)using the .Reset event type to inform the UI components that the collection has changed.,0
2694,In the current version we have optimized the collection so it knows *exactly* what has changed in the suspension state.,0
2695,We will only invoke the correct Add / Remove actions for all the items.,0
2696,Unfortunately it looks like the UI components (in this case a ListBox) cannot deal with the .Add and *multiple items*.,0
2697,This does not work:,0
2701,The event args implementation correctly contains all the added items and the right indexes (all covered by unit tests).,0
2714,For some notes on the investigation see https://github.com/Catel/Catel/issues/1066,0
2715,I *think* this is a bug in the way the UI components deal with the NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs instance.,0
2716,If it's add the components don't loop all the,0
2718,I don't see this limitation documentated anywhere (but I might have missed it).,0

2728,In 2017 .NET Native is still not mature and still has bugs.,0
2730,Interestingly Apps wrapped with Desktop Bridge do not have to use .NET Native.,0
2734,I would like to create my own Windows Wheel implementation for an existing bluetooth device that sends events over the BLE GATT protocol (not HID).,0
2735,I know it is possible to use something like https://github.com/ms-iot/samples/tree/develop/HIDInjector but having to write c++ code for Bluetooth is holding me back.,0
2736,I would much rather write some UWP-like background application in C# that injects RadialController events.,0
2737,When using a company Store account with associated developer accounts its presently not possible for the developers to raise support issues for Store problems.,0
2738,It requires the company account to be signed in to raise the case.,0
2739,This is a real problem where we have multiple teams that are shipping apps and we need to share the 'master' account name and password with lots of people thus removing any value of using AD federation.,0
2741,WinAppDriver does not work with @WindowsFindBy annotation because AppiumFieldDecorator forces the GET /context command which is not supported by WinAppDriver.,0
2742,I understand WinAppDriver does not currently support WebView and therefore it does not support context switching so /context command is not provided.,0
2743,However the context switching is not required to support @WindowsFindBy annotated element.,0
2745,Then Appium will happily use the native locator.,0
2746,I can get the page source with current WinAppDriver and I see all the elements returned have the attributes for size (width height) or position(x y) but the values of those attribute are all zero.,0
2747,I think this is the reason why Appium Inspector does not highlight the element position in the screenshot images when an element was selected in the App Source tree or clicking on the screenshot does not select the corresponding element in the App Source tree.,0

2763,Im now developing a UWP app for multiuser registration using finguerprint.,0
2764,For that propose Im using following part of code:,0
2766, The problem I found is that it currently shows a UI dialog asking for current loged in user credentials confirmation.,0
2767,It was suppose to show afther this the Windows Hello Settings page for finguerprint detection( as is in the normal Windows 10 Windows Hello Settings page).,0
2768,Afther loged in user confirmation the dialog closes and no forther finguerprint detection is possible.,0

2801,For large teams just having one team member being able to do this is a bad design decision.,0
2802,The API is fine but where I'm running into trouble is that things like Flyouts and Dialogs intercept any and all access to the event.,0

2832,Next/Previous Behaviour : the available screen will show the max number of items in the row of the control according to size of the control and size of the items in it.,0
2836,I haven't found any possible way to do that so I assume it doesn't exist currently.,0
2838,The SerialDevice implementation appears to be very unstable in general but doubly so when compiling as Native.,0
2839,The following will reliably throw some flavor of interop exception:,0

2842,As of now it's only possible to set the CalenderIdentifier property to tell the control which calender to use.,0
2843,It's not possible to set the Hijri adjustment for the month of Ramadan/Shaban though which can vary per region/user (some users like to use the adjustment of a different country).,0
2844,The Windows 10 Calender app show cases this feature with their calender when you set the alternative calender to Hijri a new setting shows up which is Hijri adjustment and it works nice.,0
